","I'm just going to get straight to the point: I liked some aspects of this movie and disliked other parts. Cinematography: awesome. Choreographed musical numbers: hilarious. Comedy: good. Margot Robbie: great. Ryan Gosling: awesome, and arguably the best part of the movie. The scenery and props really did help create the world. The storyline started off very intriguing. However, when the movie got to the meat of the plot and the central conflict, its message became confusing. It's like they wanted to make Ken the bad guy yet also sympathetic, which is not impossible or unheard of, but the way the writers did this was ineffective. Also, the resolution didn't make sense based on the message and events that led up to it. Lastly, I really hate it when movies try to empower women by dumbing down the men. I get that in a Barbie world, Ken is an afterthought, but in the real world all men were also dumb. They also treated masculine qualities as ""evil."" I hate stereotyping people, men included, and it's like all men ride horses and have fragile egos and drink ""brewskies."" And for goodness sake, if I had a dollar for every time the movie said ""patriarchy"", I'd be rich. So, overall, I give this movie a 6/10.","

","Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie. Overall, the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at, but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the ""strong"" woman.","

","The first thing you need to know about Barbie is that Ryan Gosling is the best part of the entire film. For the duration he is over the top, dumb and hilarious. Every scene he was in had me laughing and I enjoyed just about everything he did in the film.Margot Robbie is a great choice for Barbie and as usual puts in a fantastic performance. She hit pretty much every mark in my opinion and I can't see anyone taking her place in this role.Where the film falls flat unfortunately is not the characters, actors or even humour for that matter. It's the incessant political lecturing.It's no surprise that this film takes a strong feminist angle. That's to expected. Barbie was a doll that portrayed many different professions in an attempt to show young girls that they could strive for me than what they were told they could do. But that was the 1950s. This is 2023.By no means is the world a perfect representation of equality today, but it is so vastly superior in that category than it ever has been that the theme of the film falls a little flat. Telling young girls to go after their dreams and not be beholden to any stereotypes is a positive, wonderful message and one that could've been portrayed so much better. But instead, the film teeters on the edge of a radical feminist position.I've seen a lot of people say the film hates men. I disagree with this. I don't think it hates men. Instead, it takes a very simplistic, black and white view of Western culture and assumes that women's lives are overall difficult and men's lives are overall quite easy. When in reality, life is tough. For everyone. At least 99% of us. Claiming otherwise is unjust.However, it's not just the political stance it takes that brings the film down. It's how incessant it is. They are without any shame pushing a political message through the screen down your throat every 10 minutes. It's unbearable at times. Going to the cinema or watching a film should be an enjoyable experience, not a lecture.This film could've been beloved by all genders and ages. Both men and women love Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling. This feels like an easy lay up for the filmmakers but by going the political route they end up having many jokes go over kids heads and alienate many of the people who where genuinely excited to see this film.I give it a 6/10 because of Gosling and most of the humour. It was enjoyable overall. I think Hollywood needs to stop employing multi millionaire actors to lecture the general public on how to live. It's embarrassing.","

","As much as it pains me to give a movie called ""Barbie"" a 10 out of 10, I have to do so. It is so brilliantly handled and finely crafted, I have to give the filmakers credit. Yes, I am somewhat conservative person and former law enforcement officer. I'm a guy. I like guy things. Hell I even enjoyed the Battleship movie a few years ago (an absolutely ridiculous but fun romp of an action film). But I also like to experience other perspectives. And man oh man does this movie deliver that in spades - pretty much encapsulated everything my wife has tried to convey about her entire career and life experience wrapped up into two hours! The humor, the sets, the acting, and the ability to weave the current narrative into the story was just perfect. I don't agree with some of the points of the movie, but again, that's ok. This movie wasn't designed to give a balanced perspective of men versus women; it is a no-holds-barred unapologetic crazy ride of a rant about the real issues that women have faced since they were ""allowed"" to have ""real jobs"" and do the same things as men. Give me a well done film that is a blast to watch, that makes you think, and that was done from a place of creativity, passion, and attention to detail, and I'll call it what it is: a 10 out of 10 masterpiece.","

Everybody sorta agrees on that.Kids are probably not the target audience, although if they would watch it, they wouldnt be shocked or something, they would merely be missing the social and gender issues and jokes of many scenes.The second reason to go see it:It really looks the part. I am not into sets or costumes in particular (at all), but I was impressed with the fun world they had created. It really looks fabulous and I really appreciate it when a movie is eyecandy from start till finish.The third and best reason to go see it:I am a dude and I honestly feared the worst when going along with my wife. But I honestly did not expect this sugarcoated, fairytale Barbieworld to touch my heart in the end, but it did! What the what!They somehow created a finale, that gave me goosebumps and a terrific feel good vibe. You cant wish for more than that. As a dude watching a Barbie picture. Hello!The only reason AGAINST seeing it:If you are a dude and dont like men being portrayed as weak and emotionally inferior to women, then better not go see it, because all the men are (hilarious) loosers and whiners in this movie, with a brilliant performance by Ryan Gosling as an insecure crybaby, who just cant get Barbie to love him.Feared the worst, but in the end I was pleasantly suprised. It's certainly not a brilliant movie, but it is a perfect summer escape movie, with lots of jokes and a wonderful feel good vibe!","

There were dance sequences like in the olden days (think Grease) and the costuming , wow the costuming. Greta Gerwig dug deep to make this masterpiece using all of her technical chops along the way. The casting director also nailed it, everyone was wonderful.The acting was perfection, I loved seeing the variety of Barbie's on screen and there were so many jokes that would be appropriate for all audiences, this has to be a voluntary PG13 rating as there wasn't swearing or nudity. There was one beach fight amongst the Kens but that's not really violence compared to today's average films, no one was harmed nor any fake blood used.I actually didn't like the ending at all, and I was quite annoyed that Rhea Perlman played the creator of Barbie but made two quips about the IRS getting her for tax evasion - something Ruth Handler never dealt with. Her problem was with the SEC after she had signed off on a positive Mattel earnings forecast when they knew they were in a down quarter - how's that so tough to explain?Irregardless, I want to see this movie again.

","As a woman that grew up with Barbie, I was very excited for this movie. I was curious to see how they would evolve the ""stereotypical Barbie"" into something more. But the messaging in this movie was so heavy handed that it completely lost the plot. I consider myself a proponent of gender equality, and this ain't the way to get it.Barbieland flips the script on the patriarchy of the real world, giving women the power and leaving the Kens as attractive accessories. Once Ken gets a glimpse of the real world he brings the patriarchy to Barbieland and the Barbies are ""brainwashed"" (this happens suddenly and without much explanation). The Kens are bumbling fools with zero understanding of governance, and Barbieland falls into disarray.The movie's solution to this is for the Barbies to give a lot of Ted talks on the patriarchy, fool the Kens into war with each other, and rule once again. But isn't the point if gender equality... equality?The feminist messaging could have been so much more effective if it was laid on so THICK. More humor and nuance please. The story gets lost, the real world characters don't add much, and not much changes in the end.What was enjoyable was the acting, the sets and of course the nostalgia.","

","I don't know if I put spoilers in here. I am super worn out. Haha So I will just put that I did.I had no clue what this movie was like or about. It just seemed like a strange, different type of movie. To me, it was going to be some kind of movie for kids that tells you everything is perfect. It was nothing like that.There were a couple of young teen girls on the right of my mom and me. I felt weird knowing that. There is no way I would bring a kid or teen to see this.The movie is really all focused on political and gender views. So that one totally surprised me.There are points in which I kind of rolled my eyes. A bit of the singing kind of went on. There were also times that I was all teary.There are sexual references in this. Young kids would not understand. But one part in which she tells of a specific thing that she does not have, and a specific thing Ken does not have, that was a bit strange.The end threw me off. Here is a movie that seems to be saying we are equal, but we are not treated that way. Yet, at the same time it seems to be making men out to be mindless idiots. Also, something one of the male characters asks at the end and the reply the woman gives, seems to lead one to believe that things will be the exact same as they were. But unlike the way things seem to be, in Barbie land, the women will be above all men. I didn't really get that. Then, what may be the last lines of the movie, place Barbie somewhere. I didn't get the point of it.I heard adults laughing repeatedly. The kids that were their kind of sat silent.This is one of those movies that I cannot see every watching again. But it was fun and unique seeing it in the theater. Also, I dug the set design all the other stuff in the Barbie world. It was just cool to see.","

BARBIE kind of succeeds there: I loved the costuming and sets of Barbieland, and Margot Robie is such a fantastic actress, the perfect embodiment of the optimistic, she-can-do-it-all Barbie. Ryan Gosling was a scene-stealer with his horse obsession and faux mink coat.Despite all this, the movie as a whole was disappointing. As much as it succeeds at campy comedy and musical numbers, its attempts at feminist commentary and existentialism fall flat. The messaging is so on the nose, spelled right out for the audience so no one will have to strain their brain. Not that these scenes can't be funny or hit home (the guitar gag gave me college flashbacks), but a little subtlety could not have hurt.I also had issues with the differences between Barbieland and the real world. I can accept everyone in Barbieland talking in what many term ""Marvel speak."" If you've watched anything made in the past 15 years you'll recognize it right away: ""You know, we make all these pop culture references (like Spiderman in the MCU with ALIENS) and we say what we think in the bluntest way possible because it's so awkward that it's funny... oooor it WAS when it was novel and new years ago. Now it's staler than a can of Pepsi Clear. Oh yeah-- I remember the 90s! Macarena!""The Barbies and Kens are supposed to be simplistic figures with no sense of emotional nuance. However, the humans in the real world are supposed to be the opposite-- messy, complicated, not that charming. Why are they also talking like that? It just feels lazy.And then there are the existential themes: Margot Robie's Barbie gets tired of being an ideal of independent womanhood in an eternal paradise. At the end, she chooses to be human and embrace mortality because mortality is ultimately what gives our lives meaning. A decent theme. Too bad the movie never really delves into it. It's given lip service, nothing more.It had some cute moments but honestly, the end experience was meh. The hype was more memorable than the finished product.","

Here is my review written as a pretentious critic that I aspire to be in my next life:In Greta Gerwig's latest directorial venture, ""Barbie,"" the esteemed filmmaker takes on the monumental task of unravelling the enigma that is Barbie, the iconic doll that has fascinated and polarized society for decades.With Margot Robbie as the eponymous character and Ryan Gosling as Ken, Gerwig's live-action rendition delves into the complex world of Barbie, attempting to extract deeper meaning from this cultural phenomenon.Gerwig masterfully navigates the treacherous waters of branded material, infusing the narrative with a blend of adventure, comedy, fantasy, and romance. The result is a thought-provoking exploration of Barbie's role as a feminist symbol, challenging societal perceptions of femininity and girlhood.Can a doll with impossibly perfect features and a smile of perpetual happiness truly embody feminist ideals?Gerwig compels the audience to contemplate this question, weaving it throughout the fabric of the film.In reality Margot Robbie dominated the film as expected and has developed into a true cinematic icon. The flm was fun and far above my expectations hence I'm giving it an 8 and boasting I watched Barbie.","

","I've been excited for this movie for over a year. The casting was perfect and the acting was amazing! The set was next level, the tiny details were all there and even the highest barbie fan couldn't ask for anything more from it. It is PERFECTION.The first half of the movie was really good, a decent plot, plenty of laughs and a decent explanation of what is going on. Unfortunately, after a while it just becomes a rant about feminism & how oppressed women are. I'm a woman myself, and I'm all for equal rights, but the amount they shoved into this movie just overtook the fun completely, it felt very forced and by the end, you were left with the same feeling you get after scrolling through a toxic comment thread on a social media post. So sad.( SPOILERS AHEAD )Even more sad, the end message of the film when the barbies take back barbieland is basically that they are no better than the kens (or 'men') are. They manipulate them, undermine them, and then when given the chance to be better (the kens asking to have one ken presented in the Supreme Court which is all barbies), they laugh and tell them no, choosing to treat the kens or 'men' how they've 'always' treated women. So they are no better than the kens in the end. How sad! Isn't there a world where they can be better? Include the kens and all be equals?? What are we trying to teach young girls? That feminism is demeaning men just like we have been demeaned in the past? Also, I would have hoped we were past making a movie entirely about how 'hard' women have it. Life is hard for most people, men & women alike, and it's easier when we acknowledge that and treat each other like fellow humans instead of two warring species..","

19,19,/tt1517268,portraitofaladyonfire,20 July 2023," Brilliant observations, but social depth is missing
","Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach have a knack for incorporating the many little observations of life, whether funny or deeply interpersonal, into a screenplay. Gerwig manages to direct them with great visuals and clever transitions.Unfortunately, the only major weakness of the film, in my opinion, also lies in the screenplay. When dealing with larger societal issues, it lacks depth and possibly understanding. The observations work, but the contextualization falls short. The approach feels crude and superficial. This creates a confusing overall impression, as the finely crafted small observations remain convincing. A film that is so intelligent, funny, and creative on an individual level suddenly seems foolish in the grand scheme of things.Key moments in the film, such as the encounter with the inventor, fail to evoke emotions and come across as insincere. The angry rant about the struggles of being a woman feels cheap. There seems to be a lack of sensitivity, as if someone wanted to vent without making any effort to package it intelligently.Any scenes that trigger a sense of injustice and express societal criticism in small moments no longer feel precise and may even intentionally appear exaggerated, rather than being convincing parts of a larger whole.Overall, I'm not entirely sure what to make of the film. On one hand, I had a great time, but on the other hand, I left the screening with mixed feelings.Making it even more confusing are the consistently brilliant acting performances across the board, with Ryan Gosling obviously standing out.","

Lol I'll probably go back and watch it again tbh and I'll probably purchase it once it releases on blu ray as I did rather enjoy it (seriously my mouth hurts from smiling and laughing) there are some touching moments where Robbie really shines I just wish there were a little more because as everyone I absolutely adore Margot and her films.Anyway Barbie is a blast.

21,21,/tt1517268,tm-sheehan,19 July 2023," Didn't hit my pink spot
","My Review - Barbie
In Cinemas now
My Rating 6.5/10I've been keenly looking forward to seeing this much publicised movie because I'm a great fan of Margo Robbie, Ryan Gosling and Greta Gerwig's work.I held the opinion from first hearing about it that it was either going to be brilliant and I'd love it or a huge disappointment and I'd loathe it in other words no in between for me.How ever that's not the case I didn't love it and I didn't loathe it I have to accept that I
just didn't get it ?Perhaps it's because that I'm a 70 plus baby boomer male who felt that the strong feminist message directed towards the predominantly heterosexual male patriarchy for me was just preaching to the converted .Barbie is a comedy fantasy which certainly packs a not so subtle feminist smack in the face of the men who devalue the equality and contribution that women play in our society but they won't see Barbie.The audience on this special preview was young mainly women and they seemed to get the jokes that I didn't and seemed to react very well to the movie applauding at the conclusion.No spoilers about the plot you should judge it yourself as the story is not as simple as the trailer portrays it to be. Barbie and Ken leave the other Barbies and Ken's behind in Barbieland to venture through a portal caused by a stereotypical Barbie played to perfection by Margo Robbie . Barbie is experiencing disturbing emotions that she has to explore further in the real world of humans to understand in an effort to retain her eternal optimism.Ken her buff nerdy and needy boyfriend played by Ryan Gosling joins Barbie on her quest to travel through the portal landing at Venice Beach California complete with roller skates only to discover that the values and gender roles of Barbie land are reversed in the real world . The question for both the surprised dolls is which world do they want to live in?Pink cloud sunny Barbie land where every day is the same and perfect or the human world of Corporate greed and misogyny where you grow old and die?Margo Robbie and Ryan Gosling both are impressive and their comedy timing adds a light touch to the darker undertone of the film.Barbie for me has some entertaining moments but they were melting moments for me and while I hope it's popular for the creators of the movie I'm left puzzled at what audience it's aimed at ?The male population that Greta Gerwig cleverly parodies through Ken and his Ken buddies certainly wouldn't see her movie and I think the Disney generation of under 15 would be bored .I did enjoy the technical aspects of Barbie and the incredible amount of research and effort that has gone into producing this very expensive would be box office blockbuster.I also enjoyed homage to great movies of the past like Stanley Kubric's 2001 A Space Odysee , Saturday Night Fever, and of course The Wizard of Oz .It's one of the most anticipated movies of 2023 and has been in the pipeline for over a decade and in 2018 after little action was passed into the hands of Warner Bros then in 2019 they finally announced Margot Robbie and Greta Gerwig as the lead actor-director duo for this film.Director Greta Gerwig co wrote the screenplay with her partner with Noah Baumbach basing their story on the famous Barbie fashion dolls by Mattel . It is the first live action Barbie film so a lot of creative reputations are dependent on its success .Mattel, the toy company that created Barbie obviously approved of the movie getting screen credit and representation in Greta Gerwig's clever perhaps to clever script.Mattel contributed input towards the set design of the film keeping the old-school charm of the Barbie world intact and I suspect there will be a surge in sales as all the famous Barbie dolls get a mention in this film.Noah Baumbach is Executive Producer as well as his partner Greta Gerwig and Margo Robbie the movies effervescent star are all producers on this project that has an estimated production budget of $145 million US$.Margo Robbie has been quoted as saying ""that the film's aim is to subvert expectations and give audiences ""the thing you didn't know you wanted.I'm not so sure about that statement as Barbie didn't reach my expectations and I felt the thing I didn't know I wanted wasn't what I wanted at all.Top marks to Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto who created a unique color palette for the film that Greta Gerwig named ""Techni-Barbie,"" after the Technicolor format. Also top marks to two time Academy Award Winner designer Jacqueline Durran. It's a given that costumes would be one of the most important factors about the movie,","

","My 15-year old daughter wrote the following review and posted it to my IMDB account.As a Barbie fan I was very excited for this movie. I was expecting a light-hearted goofy comedy. Instead I got a movie that felt as though it didn't know where it was going or what it was doing.The movie starts of as a fun goofy comedy, then things start changing.Things start going wrong for Barbie and she has to go to the real world to fix it. She is supposed to help the person who has been playing with her to fix her problems in Barbie Land. This on its own would've been enough for a movie, but it keeps going.Instead of going in depth about the life of the mother who has caused these problems for Barbie, the movie goes off in a totally different direction.Ken sees the real world's patriarchy and goes back to Barbie Land to replicate it. Barbie has to go back to Barbie Land to save it from its new patriarchy.By the end of the movie Barbie decides to live in the real world. The Kens of the Barbie Land are basically back to as little power they had before their uprising. I find the treatment of the Kens at the end to be hypocritical compared with the movie's supposed messaging about equalityThis movies writing and plot were bad. Even as a feminist I acknowledge that the messaging was terribly preachy. I feel as though many of these different plot ideas could've been good on their own. They are just too confusing all together.On a good note the acting and sets in this movie were really good. I loved seeing the plastic Barbie houses life-sized. The movie was also very funny at parts. I just wish the movie picked a clearer direction.","

","This movie is so much fun. It starts off really strong although the story does move away from ""Barbieland"" sooner than I would have liked. Nonetheless, it regains its footing with the final act in particular and I could not stop laughing at Ryan Gosling's portrayal of Ken. That song will forever be stuck in my head.There are also plenty of good messages to be taken away from this experience, that is if you're not an insecure middle-aged male terrified of women. I loved everything the movie had to say about the patriarchy and barbies and growing up and consumerism and so much more.I am excited to watch it again soon. The pacing is not perfect and its huge potential is not fully matched, but purely as a cinematic experience I will never forget this movie.","

But it's Aaliya's film all over. She resembles so much with Madhuri Dixit draping in some beautiful chiffon and cotton. Her role took me to memory of Rekha in Khoobsurat. For Ranveer the role was tailor made and it was a cakewalk for him. Dharmendra was excellent and Shabana was graceful. Jaya was seen imitating her hubby AB of K3G. Karan should have paid some more attention to second line of actors.Overall Karan's prowess prevailed. In the first half the characters were seen having real fun but the change in tone in second half made it chaotic and it further dips in climax. Some emotional sequences are unnecessarily dragged.Pritam's music is so typical and only Jhumka song is going to be played frequently on FM. Use of old songs sounded well to audiences born in 1950's and 1960's. Would reach to 200 Cr.

","""Soch nahi, swad wahi"", is a line said by Alia Bhatt's Rani within the movie and it's perfectly apt for this Karan Johar directorial. Rocky Randhawa and Rani Chatterjee fall in love while fearing their differences in culture, ideologies would clash, resulting in destroying their love. To fight for their love, the duo decide to exchange their respective families for 3 months where Rocky goes onto live with Rani's Bengali family while Rani moves in with Rocky's Punjabi family run by the Matriarch Dhanalakshmi Randhawa (Jaya Bachchan). How their love story survive despite the ideology clashes forms rest of the story.I wasn't prepared enough for a progressive Karan Johar family entertainer. Having said that, KJo is in full form as he is not trying to ape any other director or even please the current generation. He reclaims his identity and plays to his strength. Karan Johar is meant to narrate rich people stories and add to that a love story + lots of family drama, you get the recipe for a KJo blockbuster ready. What this films lack is good songs which again is made up by the usage of old classics.RARKPK is not without it's flaws but Karan Johar fills it with enough memorable scenes, heart touching ones, that I had to stop complaining about the lengthy runtime. Speaking of standout scenes, both first half and second half delivers them back to back. Alia shines whenever she gets to but it is Ranveer who owns the film while letting the veterans to take over their respective scenes. My only major complaint would be the Dhindora Baje song as Dola Re bit before that had already done the magic, also that bit was my paisa vasool moment.Karan Johar truly upgrades his arsenal, while the standing upto the matriarch might be the major plot point, several other issues are highlighted sensibly and kudos to the team. Sure, the initial scenes are jerky, trying a bit too hard while introducing the two main leads but after that it's a smooth narrative. The ode to classic songs or to other films' famous lines including the one from K3G, Karan Johar has packed a solid entertainer.","

Terrific acting by them. Dharam paaji without even saying anything shows how potent acting is without dialogues. The first time he mouths a full sentence, I got literal goosebumps. Ranveer is an absolute firecracker as he gets into his own element and owns the character of Rocky Randhawa. He shows his comic range as well as emotional range with aplomb. Alia goes toe to toe with him as their chemistry is sizzling. All the talk after watching the video of 'tum kya mile' about their non existent chemistry goes down the drain once both of them appear in the frame together. 1st half is a laughter riot and the second half takes over a more serious tone and touches upon some serious issues which are handled well given how mainstream the film is and who has made it. The film is just a shade under 180 mins but I never for a second gets boring. This is easily Kjo's best work. Go watch it and have a fun, relaxing and chill weekend.

","Karan Johar returns to the direction after a long gap and this time he delivers a romantic story which has more laughter & emotions then romance. In past times Karan has delivered blockbuster movies like KKKG & KKHH and this film also goes on a same track but the it couldn't hold the audience till the end. Talking about the storyline some scenes is superbly shot like there are tons of Comedy dialogues & funny scenes which will audience definitely enjoy and laugh but still it'll give you same vibes as his rest of his films. There is long list of Star cast and all have given an amazing performance and that's what keeps you hooked to this film. RANVEER SINGH shines throughout the film though he doesn't have charm of romantic hero type but still he gives his 100% and proves that he is still in the race.ALIA BHATT another powerful performance by her but this time she is in 2nd spot because Ranveer has totally stole the limelight. Both the lead cast have some amazing scenes with powerful dialogue conversation which is amazing to watch. Dharmendra & Shabana Azmi first of all it's great to see Old Actors after such a longtime but still they have short roles not much but they are very much impactful..
Supporting cast has also done justice to their characters, Songs are average but DHOLIDA song definitely give you chills because that scene is amazing to see. Karan Johar always known for focusing on Grand & Colourful sets which is quite good to see but it doesn't required if you doesn't have a proper & unique story to tell.All n all it's a proper family Entertainer with an average story you can definitely watch it for one time.....","

","Knowing that Karan Johar is coming back with a movie directed by him is always exciting but this one is not what I expected from him. Yes it has large scale, big sets, big multistar cast but an important thing is missing that a good story. A concept inspired from Subhash Ghai's Saudagar mixed with recently released Jio Cinema's Ishq-e-Nadaan sprinkled with badly sung evergreen songs (why didn't he use old songs in background with original voices) and added K3G like drama.Dharmendra, Shabana Azmi and Alia Bhat are only saving grace. Good music and songs which are always highlight of KJo movies are also missing barring only Tum Kya Mile.","

34,34,/tt14993250,harpreetc,29 July 2023," Loved every moment of it.
","I knew I'd like the movie. Because I am an Alia fan. Because I love old school family dramas. Because I enjoy Karan Johar's direction and vision. I ended up loving the movie.RR has all the masala and the twists for a Bollywood hit. And it feels like a hit without a single macho punch being pulled anywhere on screen. It also hit close to home for very personal reasons. There are simply too many similarities right now between my life and various episodes in the film. I think that's important for a good movie. And that's why I loved it - because I connected with it.The story is simple. An intelligent, self-made, independent, educated woman falls in love with a rich, loud, narcissistic, lovable, carefree man. Families realise the disparity and the lovers decide to test themselves in each other's spaces for a few months.In the midst of it all, you throw in a septuagenarian romance that's links the families further. A matriarch who governs with an iron hand (already done in Ram Leela with a far greater flair) but this doesn't include physical but emotional violence. A house governed by ambition and a quest for material prosperity. The other house governed by freedom and a quest for intellectual betterment and acceptance.The movie doesn't just tackle the romance and the odds of the hero and heroine. But interlinked within the families, each character struggles to find a voice or realises that the voice they were using could be biased at best and cruel at worst, as well.The film has both Pride and Prejudice. It's a subtle encapsulation of how people look down upon people, how we form prejudices based on past experiences and why it is important to realise our own trauma and make peace with due apologies. Every person in the movie is flawed. And growth happens with the realisation of these flaws and seeking to better one's self through mature decisions. The only abrupt change that seemed jarring was the write-off they gave Dhanlakshmi, Jaya's character. But in a way, it was for the best, because it was in keeping with her character that the change wasn't radical or real, but implied off-screen.Dharmendra and Jaya Bachchan are brilliantly cast in characters just made for them. Shabana steals the screen when she is on it, as the woman who experienced true love for a few days that lasted a lifetime. She battled abuse and raises a son who is different from the typical idea of what a man should be and do, in India. This is brave (uncannily) and well handled by Karan. The scene where Alia's father is ridiculed speaks to every boy who grows up different in a patriarchal society. Ranveer's Rocky wears an outfit that's vomit green as he laughs with the crowd. I noticed it, Karan.The monologue Rocky gives addressing the ridicule Rani's father faced, after a Kathak performance, is worth an honourable mention. It speaks of the need to understand not just what is considered woke in the modern day world but also the dangers of cancel culture that circles around it. For those who say that never happens to men who are into classical dance, you truly either live in a different world or choose to ignore the problems that are very much around in this world.Rani's character excels in her confrontation with Rocky's father. It is the frustration of all liberal mentality that reaches a crescendo there. The dangers of that is almost as bad as the despotic power that Dhanlakshmi holds over her entire family. Almost. But not quite.The costumes were extensions of the characters. Rani was mostly dressed in the most beautiful sarees, since Sridevi's performance in English Vinglish. Red being her colour and the implication of red being the colour of true love and passion, given it being the colour of the most sensitive character, of Rocky's grandfather, essayed by Dharmendra. It is perhaps the colour that flares out when poetry is ousted by industry. Rocky thus wears a riot of colours, because he has it all in him and Ranveer can carry off all of them because he knows he can.There are a multitude of old song covers. Mostly from a favourite film of mine, Hum Dono. And the songs set to the OST of the movie are not particularly engaging but they work for the tempo of the movie. My favourite is actually not the title song but Ve Kamleya.All in all, I end with my personal opinion that Karan Johar has written a wonderful script. He has applied himself once again to creating a family drama for the modern world and he has succeeded. The movie is exemplary for the fact that it speaks of breaking away from issues that do not truly matter and finding ground in a world that is trying to find a place for each person's uniqueness.","

36,36,/tt14993250,oazam-94021,28 July 2023," Not the ""Kahaani"" you'd expect from Karan Johar
","The B-wood industry has been yearning for one thing and one thing only - MONEYYY! This is an evident example of how talentless people steal the spotlight for those who have been trying to pursue their passion but can't thanks to the veterans who have been loaded for their children.So this is a film that centers around 2 characters from different cultural/traditional backgrounds.Meet Rocky Randhawa and Rani ChatterjeeRocky comes from a stereotypical but affluent Punjabi background that consists of his parents Tijori and Poonam, his grandparents Kanwal and Dhanlakshmi, and his sister Gayathri a.k.a Golu. Dhanlakshmi runs a ""mithai"" empire and is considered the matriarch of the house with lack of respect for her daughter-in-law.Rani comes from a conservative and traditional Bengali background that consists of her parents Chandon and Anjali, and her grandmother Jamini. She is a news anchor by profession while her mother is a literature professor and her dad, a Kathak dancing instructor while Jamini runs the household.The fall in love element comes into play due to the past history of Kanwal and Jamini as they were in love a long time ago but due to their differences, they couldn't be together. So coincidentally, Rocky and Rani meet, fall in love, and decide to get marriedDue to the family's oppositions, they decide to switch places to prove their worthiness and how their fate is what forms their love story along with healing the past and the present of the Randhawas.Okay, might seem like a decent plot but the film focuses too much on the family drama aspect rather than the romantic aspect of the film that was supposed to be there. The screenplay was completely erratic and convoluted to a very high extent that tethered to the highest of predictability levels.First a fall in love scenario and then the rest of the 90-100 mins on the family drama aspect. So it's like ADHM & HSKD in the beginning, then K3G & BKD in the middle, and lastly spice it up with a copied KKHH and 2-states climax.So it's a hybrid from KJo's filmography. A typical ending to any KJo film, the guy wins the girl after all the maafi's have been done from both respective families .This is clearly apparent how originality is diminishing from the face of this industry and how nepotism is being heavily triggered and this film is a clear example of this issue. Exploitation, nothing else.When it comes to performances, this is one aspect that can be accepted as both the lovebirds performed immaculately in their roles.Ranveer Singh was able to display a flamboyant persona on screen while Alia Bhatt was subtle and nuanced and did make herself leave a decent impression in front of the audience.The veterans Jaya Bachchan, Dharmendra, and Shabana Azmi were also good in their respective roles and managed to bring a bit of that spark in this confusing film.Jaya Bachchan reminded me of Yash Raichand, Dharmedra acted almost like Rishi Kapoor from Kapoor & Sons while Shabana Azmi acted like Farida Jalal from KKHH.Dharmedra portrayed a aging and amnesiac grandfather with not many dialogues but his presence was doable.Supporting cast were fine but Aamir Bashir's role reminded me of Ronit Roy from 2 States. Same anger and attitude along with that complacent personality.Pritam has made quite a comeback with some decent tunes but What Jhumka was a bit too much despite its slight peppiness it adds as original music exists for a reason. Tum Kya Mile and Ve Kamleya were the major highlights of this album and the melodious voice of Arijit managed to add some magic to this film.Cinematography was fine and the editing was decent but could've been more crisper since ADHM looked better than this. Wish KJo wrote this rather than having his pay-rolled staff pen this confusion and have him sit in front of the camera. This is exploitationOverall, Karan Johar needs to see the potential talent in front of him despite how nicely Alia Bhatt and Ranveer Singh performed but the narrative needs work. Too predictable and I think 90% of the audience know your filmography thank you.2.5/5 - A Dharma wound.","

","To start with, this review is for only those who believe its not right to target any movie or person or bunch of people just because of who they are born to, how they choose to spend their money and whom they choose to love!This movie is a quintessential Karan Johar movie thy has got one thing his movies always are packed with. ENTERTAINMENT!No surprises in terms of story and is quite predictable there. What surprised me is the way it was handled, how honest the writing is and impactful dialogues. At every possible situation i was expecting preachy dialogues but i guess more was achieved by less noise. Ranveer is believable and looks comfortable with the role. Alia has been made to look matured and intellectually sound but it was probably a tad bit over dramatic. However her performance is convincing. Supporting characters are excellent esp Rani's Parents and Rockys mother. Music/Songs are definitely disappointing and a better output would have elevated the movie for sure.Overall an important message packed in a fun, branded and colourful package addressed to everyone around who is at crossroads of gender equality.Quirky note : If only Rekha played Shabana Azmi's role and Amitabh Bacchan played Dharmendra's role, this movie would have surpassed all records by now 😊","

","With lots of trepidation, I mustered the courage to watch a Hindi film in a movie theater. But to my utter astonishment, I was in for a surprise. This is a good film.The movie cleverly addresses the cancel culture, misogyny, and patriarchy in the Indian milieu, hidden beneath the glitz and glamour of Manish Malhotra's exquisite costumes. It's like tricking a child into swallowing medicine by masking it inside a kool-aid.It serves as an exposé on age-old Indian traditions and gender stereotypes, presented in a format catering to the audience of the past. However, times have changed, and there is no need to disguise the truth anymore. Certainly content wise this is Karan's most progressive work to-date.Still, overall, it's a pleasant watch that one can endure in the confines of a movie theatre. Ranveer Singh shines as brightly as his clothes, adding the bling factor for sure. Alia is effective, supporting cast get their moment and they deliver. Watch it for some good old Bollywood charm, nostalgia aided and embellished by some retro Hindi songs.A paisa- vasool entertainment!","

Leaving your brains behind and getting absorbed in a fantasy tale that entertains.Is there anything wrong with having opulent settings, designer clothes, larger than life events, music and colourful song sequences? In fact, that's the heart of Bollywood.Add to that the creme de la creme of actors - Jaya Bachchan, Shabana Azmi, Aamir Bashir and the evergreen, charming Dharmendra. They have so much experience. And abundant talent to showcase. With additional pep from the younger brigade starting with Alia Bhatt and Ranveer Singh. Brazen and blitzy, not lacking any which way in acting chops.KJo reclaims his identity and plays to his strength.RARKPK is not without its faults but it is filled with enough memorable scenes that one can stop complaining.The initial bits were loud and trying a bit too hard while introducing the two leads but after that it's a smooth trip. The first half is full of laughs. The second half is what makes it wholesome. It touches some serious issues which are handled well given how mainstream the film and its maker are.Go ahead and judge me. But I enjoyed the film a lot. Go and see it in theatres.

","""Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani"" marks director Karan Johar's latest venture, and unfortunately, it falls into familiar territory. The film, like some of his previous works, follows a generic storyline with unrealistic melodrama and an excessive focus on family issues, which may not resonate well with everyone. The movie seems to rely heavily on extravagant visuals and locations, possibly trying to capitalize on aesthetics rather than substance.One of the key criticisms that some viewers may have is the promotion of nepotism in the film. It's no secret that Karan Johar has faced scrutiny in the past for his preference for star kids, and this movie seems to perpetuate that image. This could be a significant point of contention for audiences who believe in giving equal opportunities to talent from all backgrounds.While the film may have its drawbacks, it's essential to acknowledge that filmmaking is subjective, and there might be those who enjoy the blend of family drama and glitzy aesthetics. It's still worth noting that some viewers may find the narrative and treatment outdated, given the changing sensibilities of audiences.Overall, ""Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani"" fails to break new ground and feels like an attempt to recreate the same formula used in Karan Johar's earlier movies. Whether it's a hit or miss depends on individual preferences, but it does leave room for a more diverse and inclusive approach to storytelling in Bollywood.","

","Karan Johar's latest gives you all the right flavours of quienessential bollywood making it a perfect entertainerMy Rating : 80/100Rocky Aur Rani Ki Prem Kahaani serves you with everything Bollywood is famous for and rightfully presented by one true Bollywood fan, i.e Karan Johar. It has the lavish set designs, glowing chartbusters, wicked and fresh humour and innumerable callbacks to his older filmography. The film even though progressive becomes preachy many a times but Karan blends humour, style and comfort music from the past to keep the tempo and depth of the film alive. Ranveer Ranveer steals the show with his versatile whacky performance and Alia doesn't dissapointment eithet. The humour is excellent and music even though not the best from Pritam surely keeps you hooked. Ranveer and Alia's chemistry takes a backseat when powerpacked ensemble cast steal the limelight. Impactful supporting performances by the entire cast. This one surely is made for all the families who are fans of good ol bollywood films.The film made me so glad to see Ranveer back as show stealer, just gave me the vibes of his flamboyance in his debut in Band Baaja Baraat. Give him a difficult role and he delivers it with ease. The dynamics of his performance may give him a lot of nominations next year. Alia is versatile and her performance is equally convincing. The ensemble cast is excellent. Not taking names specifically but everyone is just so good. Thw film even being long at 169 minutes never has any dull moment, yes the first half can be a bit cringy but it can be easily overlooked. Second half has the depth which carries it over the line.Overall, Karan delivers a film with all you expect from Bollywood and why its famous for. Even while Karan wildly supports nepotism, he even gave special appearances to all modern day nepo kids which is bold and much like Karan. But in the meanwhile he still delivers a film worth loving and enjoying. This one is a winner and all true Bollywood fans will enjoy it.Instagram , Threads, Twitter : @streamgenx.","

","You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest. A really great watch.","

50,50,/tt15398776,Jeremy_Urquhart,20 July 2023," A challenging watch to be sure, but a worthwhile one.
","One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't. And that's still worth celebrating, and makes Oppenheimer worth seeing in cinemas for sure.","

51,51,/tt15398776,MrDHWong,20 July 2023," A brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws
","""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.","

Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day! One of my favorite Nolan movies!","

Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.","

55,55,/tt15398776,Geekofriendly,26 July 2023," Nolan touches greatness, falls just slightly short
","I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---At least 60% of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act of the movie needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending of the movie could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The movie is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb.","

","Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long but goes through very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.I highly recommend this film to everyone.

The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight.

That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.","

61,61,/tt15398776,FeastMode,21 July 2023," An unpopular opinion from a die-hard Nolan fan
","Christopher Nolan is my favorite director of all time. He has four of my top six movies, eight of my top twenty. It's absurd how much joy he's given me. I consider him, to the full extent of the word, a genius.Let me start by saying this is an objectively good movie. The technical aspects are all up to the Nolan standards. The acting is fantastic from a ridiculous cast. The ones that stood out to me the most are the always amazing Emily Blunt and the soon-to-be Oscar winner (hopefully) Downy Jr.Subjectively... I hate to say it but I found it boring. And it's not because it's too long. I think a movie should be as long as it needs to be and hate when studios mess with the art to achieve shorter runtimes. The reason I was bored is because I was fairly uninterested and not invested. It did not evoke emotions, something Nolan normally does better than anyone. I even checked the time at one point, something I never imagined I'd say about a Nolan movie.While it was still a treat to see this in IMAX with the expanded aspect ratio, there isn't anything that wowed me aside from one scene. Part of why I love Nolan movies is that feeling of awe from witnessing something on screen that I've never seen before or could possibly imagine. Not the case here.This isn't a criticism because the musical score is really good and works for the movie. But I'm begging Nolan to reunite with Hans Zimmer. No one is on his level. The musical scores for Inception, Interstellar and The Dark Knight trilogy are iconic. They are stuck in your head on the way home. You add them to your playlist and listen to them repeatedly, even a decade later. Everyone will recognize the music from those movies, even if they haven't seen it in years. Again, not the case here.I want to emphasize that this is my subjective opinion. I don't normally go for historical/biographical movies. Part of the reason sci-fi is my favorite genre is because of its limitless possibilities. A movie based in reality is much more limited but can still be really creative if it's fiction (like Memento and Following). But a biographical film about real events is extremely limited and lacks the beauty of the unknown. Dunkirk at least made up for it with amazing action scenes.If you enjoy historical movies, you will probably love this like everyone else. For me, it felt like a really well-made movie we'd watch in history class on movie day. I'm endlessly sad that I have to wait another three years for a new Nolan movie, and hope that he switches back to something more intriguing than the life of a scientist.(1 viewing, opening Thursday IMAX 7/20/2023)","

","I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in.

65,65,/tt15398776,tm-sheehan,20 July 2023," Stunning - put it in a time capsule
","My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.","

",This movie pretends to be clever and artistic but in reality it's just a meandering bloated effort. The cast is wonderful and their performances do have merit there's no question about that. The fault is the story itself. You get the feeling that Christopher Nolan is such a big time director that no one around him has the guts to tell him no. When you surround even the most talented people with Yes Men the result is often inferior. Such is the case with this movie. The story is told through semi flashbacks and a jumping time narrative. What results is unsatisfying and what is seen has very little depth. They try to paint two historical figures back and forth as flawed protagonist yet fail in the delivery.,"

68,68,/tt15398776,leestoych,22 July 2023," Technically superb but...
","At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.","

","Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have.

74,74,/tt9603212,masonsaul,10 July 2023," Best franchise currently going
","Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.","

75,75,/tt9603212,subxerogravity,12 July 2023," I think Tom Cruse may have single handily saved movie theatres.
","This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture. It was worth having to stay in me seat for almost three hours just so they can add a little more action in-between the Hero's journey dialogue.And this is just part one!? Part two has some big shoes to fill!","

Tom is literally going to die if he keeps doing these stunts. The motorbike sequence is utterly ludicrous.

Like nothing you have ever experienced on screen before.Everything gets exponentially more epic as time passes. You think ""Surely now this has peaked"" .. but NO! Something else will come crashing onto screen, the stakes will rise even higher, and off we go again..The pacing is quite unique - it feels like a sequence of thrilling short-films, while still working as a whole narrative. There is an awesome momentum pulsing through every moment. I can't imagine how they will top this with Part 2 - but I cannot wait to find out!Epic movement, ambition, stunts, humour, brilliant new characters and sheer bravado behind the camera. How did they ever film this practically.. in a pandemic! Obviously you should watch this on the biggest cinema screen possible. The moment where a train enters a tunnel - literally breath-taking.If I were looking for faults.. I would say the 2 exposition scenes drag on a bit - it almost felt like they were repeating themselves. But even then you can't complain because they are so stylishly filmed - more so then ever before in this franchise.Just let Cruise and McQuarrie produce every action film made from now on. Nobody else is remotely close to their level. I would gladly watch this again immediately. Booking the tickets right now.","

78,78,/tt9603212,ferguson-6,9 July 2023," number 7 is even bigger
","Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge in continuing the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be ""bigger"" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt's biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is ""Part One"" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise's TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with 'saving cinema', so stay on alert for a 'sky is falling' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (""Band of Brothers""), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a 'simple' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it's fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt's mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he's paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt's team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It's nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a 'making of' video that's been available for a while. As movie goers, we've never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It's been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ... Cruise was 34 in that one. This particular mission is the biggest yet, and it would certainly be impossible for the rest of us. It's a mission that will be closed out in Part Two, and simultaneously bring an end to Cruise's remarkable run as Ethan Hunt.Opening July 12, 2023.","

","'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I (M:I7) is another strong entry in the action/spy series, with Ethan (Cruise) looking slightly older, but not less determined to save the world. I believe the sequel to this film will be his last outing - but we'll see. This time, there's some Skynet-like sentient-AI that's manipulating nefarious types to take over the world, so the IMF team are out to get the two halves of key that can stop it.Isla (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Rhames) are back, as well as CIA boss Kittridge (Czerny), with Grace (Atwell), a thief, being the newcomer. The bad guys that keep thwarting them are Gabriel (Morales) from Ethan's past, and Paris (Klementieff). The consistency of having McQuarrie as director of the two previous films helps, with everything feeling assured and this working as a really solid follow-up to 'Fallout'.There's some funny moments, some sincere ones, and some of Ethan running, as contractually-obliged. The whole final scene on the train is excellent, with so many things happening, but there's plenty of good set-pieces throughout, including a good car chase. However, the piece-de-resistance is the motorbike off the cliff into a BASE jump is something else. The fact Cruise did it for real, multiple times, is crazy and inspiring.","

","A Part One that still felt like a complete movie, this is how you make a great movie in a franchise that's already going for almost 30 years and they still nailed it and keeps getting better or still as great, when you handing it on the right person like Tom Cruise who are giving his 100%, and makes a really careful good decision then it will work, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One was another achievement in action movies as a whole, this is the most serious MI movie experience i've ever experienced and one of the most serious movie experience i've ever experienced as i really locked in and really engaged to the story, following every single dialogue that are really well written, and man do we have to talk about the performance, Tom Cruise, Ving Rhames, and Simon Pegg was like a family already and i'm pretty sure they did not need any rehearsal as they chemistry was already there since the fifth one, Rebecca Ferguson and Vanessa Kirby returning performance was also great, Pom Klementieff gave a very interesting performance as a character and she was amazing in terms of action sequences, Esai Morales was a good intense villain, and last but not least Hayley Atwell at possibly her best performance she's ever in and i think she might be my favorite Ethan Hunt sort of sidekick besides his own team, she was incredible and her present was lovely every single second of it, action scene in MI movie was always in another different level, top notch craziness and just all full praises for the action sequence, they did borrowed some things but i didn't take it as a problem, one of the last sequence in the movie involving only Tom Cruise and Hayley Atwell was one of the most intense sequence i've ever seen and it was just perfect, now it's important for me to also say that the movie wasn't completely perfect as there is some couple of little poor editing in the first 15 minutes and couple of nit picky here and there but not up to the point where it's losing a big 1 score from 10 to 9, so overall Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One was another solid installment from a solid franchise, a 2 hours and 43 minutes movie that goes fly just like that because the movie was fills with great story, great performance, great action, great score, great writing, and great everything, i have a blast with Dead Reckoning Part One, and thank you Tom Cruise for making a movie that obviously made from the heart because this movie is amazing and just incredibly well made, well done Sir!","

81,81,/tt9603212,Jeremy_Urquhart,9 July 2023," A glorious action movie
","I'll admit that some of the Mission: Impossible movies blur together (though I like them all, to varying degrees), so I have to cautiously say that Dead Reckoning Part One might be the best so far. I've only seen the others once each, and didn't rewatch any in preparation for this one, but I don't remember any of the others being quite this entertaining or amazingly well-paced.After the slog that was Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, Dead Reckoning was a huge relief - a big-budget sequel in a long-running series that actually lived up to the anticipation. This film has an amazing final act- the whole last hour is just perfect, as far as action movies go, being similarly thrilling to the go-for-broke final act in the most recent John Wick.Tom Cruise is great in the action scenes of course, but he's also doing great work here in dramatic and comedic capacities, too. The rest of the cast are also all really good, and even if the most exciting part of the movie is the whole extended final sequence, the action before then is still fantastic (and includes one of the best car chases of the past few years, too).It's over-the-top action that also feels believable and authentic, and I think they just got the balance perfectly right here between hilariously ridiculous and genuinely intense/suspenseful. There's a lot of set-up near the start that felt a bit wordy - lots of silly technical jargon - but I guess they had to establish a central conflict to play out over two movies, so the extended opening was probably needed. But once it really gets going, Dead Reckoning Part One delivers some of the best blockbuster action since Max Max: Fury Road (yeah, it's almost that good).","

","With this being the first of a two-parter (shot back-to-back before, the second part will be released next year), there is speculation as to whether they will be the final two films in the successful franchise, based on the popular 1960s TV series, either way I was highly excited for this seventh entry, directed by Christopher McQuarrie (Jack Reacher, Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation & Fallout). Basically, next-generation Russian submarine Sevastopol has an advanced artificial intelligence for testing a new navigation system that uses dead reckoning (calculating the current position of a moving object by using a previously determined position). However, the AI goes rogue and tricks the crew into firing a torpedo at an invisible enemy vessel. This causes the torpedo to turn back onto the submarine itself, sinking it and killing all aboard. IMF (Impossible Missions Force) agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise, also producing) is assigned to retrieve half of a cruciform key. It is unclear what the key unlocks, but it is most likely for something potentially catastrophic. The half-key is with rogue MI6 agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), who has a bounty of $50 million from IMF on her head. Ethan travels to Saudi Arabia where he finds Ilsa hiding in the desert, knowing he is the only person she can trust. After rescuing her from a team of mercenaries he obtains the half-key. He then infiltrates a meeting of leaders of the U. S. Intelligence Community in Washington, D. C., including CIA Director Eugene Kittridge (Henry Czerny) (last seen in the original 1996 Mission Impossible) and Director of National Intelligence Denlinger (Cary Elwes), to discuss the rogue AI, named the Entity. They discuss how the Entity has achieved sentience and infiltrated the major defence, military systems, intelligence, and financial networks of the world. World powers compete to obtain the key to protect their national security and control the Entity, though it is unclear how it can be controlled. Ethan believes the Entity poses too great a threat to humanity and seeks to destroy it. He and his teammates Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) travel to Abu Dhabi International Airport to intercept the holder of the other half-key. U. S. Agents are searching for Ethan, following his actions in Washington, and going rogue, but he evades them. At the airport, Ethan sees and recognises terrorist Gabriel (Esai Morales), a figure from his part before he became an IMF agent, who is now working alongside the Entity. Hacking the airport surveillance, Luther identifies a suspicious luggage bag; Benji finds what appears to be a nuclear explosive with a word puzzle to be solved by displayed riddles and questions Benji solves the word puzzle and defuses the device, but finds it is empty. Meanwhile, the half-key is stolen by a professional thief named Grace (Hayley Atwell), who Ethan follows on plane to Rome, Italy. Ethan and Grace end up in a chase through the streets, pursued by French assassin Paris (Pom Klementieff), a subordinate for Gabriel. After Grace escapes again, Ethan reunites with Benji, Luther, and Ilsa. With support from Benji and Luther, Ethan and Ilsa infiltrate a party in Venice held by the arms dealer, Alanna Mitsopolis, aka the White Widow (Vanessa Kirby), daughter of deceased arms dealer Max (Vanessa Redgrave in the original film) who has the other half of the key. They hope to find out who hired Grace and learn of the key's purpose. Grace encounters Gabriel and learns that Alanna hired her to steal the half-key. Ethan unsuccessfully tries to talk a fearful Alanna out of selling it. Gabriel reveals that the Entity has infiltrated the party and determined that one of Ethan's allies, either Ilsa or Grace, will die. The team scatters as Grace runs through the streets, only to be caught up to by Gabriel by the canal. Ethan tries to find her, but the Entity, posing as the voice of Benji, sends him the wrong direction. Ethan gets into a fight with Paris until he manages to subdue her, but he chooses to spare her life. Gabriel subdues Grace and gets into a fight with Ilsa, ultimately ending with him fatally stabbing her, and Ethan is too late to save her. Grace joins Ethan, Benji, and Luther as she feels remorse for Ilsa's death, but Luther assures her that she is not to blame. They plan to board the Orient Express travelling to Innsbruck, Austria where will meet with her buyer. Benji makes a mask for Grace to pose as Alanna, but when he tries to make a mask for Ethan to pose as her brother Zola (Frederick Schmidt), the mask machine malfunctions. Ethan is forced to come up with a new plan to board the train, while Luther leaves for an off-grid location to break down traces of the Entity in his hard drive. Before leaving, Luther warns Ethan not to kill Gabriel out of vengeance, as only Gabriel knows how to use the key. On the train, Gabriel kills the engine crew and destroys the throttle and brake. Grace finds Alanna and she is knocked unconscious, allowing her to take her place to impersonate her and meet the buyer, revealed to be Kittridge. He meets Denlinger, who proposes he aligns himself with The Entity. Denlinger explains that the complete key unlocks the chamber housing the computer of the Sevastopol, containing the early version of the Entity that can be used to control or destroy it. Meanwhile, Ethan is on a motorbike having missed the chance to board the train, he is being directed by Benji to a way to get onboard. Finally, Ethan reaches the edge of a cliff, high above the valley with the train in view, Benji says he can parachute onto the train. Ethan backs up and drives the motorbike over the edge, leaping as it descends and deploys his parachute when far enough from the rocks. Back on the train, when Denlinger mentions his knowledge of the submarine's location, Gabriel slashes his throat. He then prepares to kill Paris, suspecting she will betray him after Ethan spared her in Venice, so he stabs her. The deal goes ahead with $100 million being transferred; Grace is tempted to betray Ethan for her own protection. But she changes her mind, pickpocketing the key from Kittridge, removing her disguise, and fleeing, just before the real Alanna wakes and walks in. Moments later, Ethan crashes through the carriage window with his parachute and saves Grace from her pursuers. But Gabriel acquires the key from her and climbs to the top of the train. Ethan goes after Gabriel, while Community agents Jasper Briggs (Shea Whigham) and his partner Degas (Greg Tarzan Davis) are also on the train and go after him. Grace heads to the front to try and stop the train from going further. Ethan overpowers Gabriel atop the train, but Jasper and Degas corner him before he can kill Gabriel, allowing him to jump off the train. Gabriel then triggers bombs beneath the upcoming bridge. Briggs and Degas try to get all the passengers to safety, while Ethan and Grace manage to detach the locomotive from the rest of the train. Ethan and Grace are forced to climb through multiple cars falling off the bridge. Just before they fall, they are saved by Paris. Before she succumbs to her wounds, she reveals the key's connection to the Sevastopol. Ethan reveals to Grace that he pickpocketed the completed key back from Gabriel during their fight and before he escaped. Ethan escapes the train with a parachute before Briggs and Degas can arrest him. Grace finds Kittridge and informs him that she wants to join IMF. Ethan reunites with Benji and shows him the key. Ethan later receives a voice message from Kittridge with his next mission, to find the Sevastopol and save the world, and he wishes Ethan good luck. Also starring Mariela Garriga as Marie, Charles Parnell as NRO, Mark Gatiss as NSA, Indira Varma as DIA, Rob Delaney as JSOC, and Marcin Dorocinski as Captain. Cruise is fantastic as the secret agent prepared to go to great lengths, and is brave to do his own stunts, Rhames and Pegg as his teammates are great support, Attwell is really likeable, and Morales and Klementieff are good as villains. It should be noted that this took longer to make and release because of the impact of COVID-19, but many would have seen the images of Cruise and the highly anticipated motorbike leap stunt, this is the most exciting sequence. The plot involving paranoia brought by a self-aware AI weapon that could destroy the world is intriguing, the set pieces are spectacular, the fights, chases, and stunts are fast-paced, tense and genuinely heart-racing, the gadgetry is cool, and the music by Lorne Balfe, including the Lalo Schifrin theme tune, is good. Along with Fallout, this ranks as the most awesome of the series and I cannot wait to see the continuation and (possible) conclusion, a highly satisfying spy action. Tom Cruise was number 32 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 25 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and he was number 81 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Very good!","

","To me, a new M:I film is an event. From Part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).There's some good stuff here for sure, and overall it's a solid 8, but it's simply not as good as previous entries.I kept noticing that a lot of scenes had just 2 or 3 people in them, and I kept imagining the crew all masked up, as well as the cast when the camera wasn't on them. It can't be easy to make a huge movie like this during a pandemic, but it definitely shows.The A. I. plot is quite good, and Hunt's as-yet-unknown backstory quite intriguing, but the whole story basically revolves around: ""I've got the key, now she's got the key, now he's got the key"" etc. So much pick-pocketing.Also, I really wish they hadn't ruined the motorcycle jump in the promos. If you've seen the promo, you've seen the scene. There are really only 3 or 4 action sequences, and nothing we haven't really seen before. I actually enjoyed the first desert shoot-out the best.And- oh!- the exposition! There's a scene near the beginning that reminded me of a Neil Breen(!) movie, where powerful people sit in a room and just spout buzz words like ""nuclear war,"" ""economic collapse,"" ""dogs and cats living together"" etc.THAT said, it's still an 8/10. Tom always gives it his best, the rest of the cast is good (especially all four female leads) and I thought the added humour with Hunt's character was a nice touch. I'd rather watch this ten times over than any blatant cyncial Disney cash-grab.","

85,85,/tt9603212,robchat,8 July 2023," A balanced review from a M:I fan ...
","I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn't know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I've felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense); I never had the feeling that I was on the edge of my seat.The motorcycle sky jump scene was a major disappointment after the hype because if you didn't know Cruise actually did do that stunt, they used so much CGI that people would just assume it was computer generated. It actually reminded me of Pierce Brosnan's riding the tsunami in Die Another Day (sorry Tom! The stunt is still awesome!).The same for the train at the end. I know they actually made that train, and probably actually threw it off a bridge, but it doesn't look real. Though it is a long action finale and very fun to watch, for me the lack of realism takes away any tension. You are enjoying it for its visual value, but again not feeling any 'wow' factor or tension.At the end of Fallout, for example, you really felt Ethan Hunt was battered, bruised, worn out and still fighting to save humanity. There is none of that.The most tragic thing about this movie is that, unlike in the best of the previous films, we're back to the team being irrelevant in this one. Benji and Luther don't actually do very much.And poor Ilsa. Fallout ended with Ethan's ex-wife essentially giving him permission to move on and be with Ilsa.The relationship between Ilsa and Hunt had been built up over two excellent movies - Rogue Nation and Fallout - and in this film she says almost nothing, looks grumpy and sad all the time, and dies in an anticlimactic fight that is literally spelt out to the audience as a way to replace her with newcomer Grace.Grace, played by Hayley Atwell, is good. A likeable character and a capable actress, but I don't get the story unless Rebecca Ferguson said she wants out the franchise.The film is all about chasing ""the key."" No twists. No high stakes. There is virtually no grittiness in this outing. It feels very light.Ultimately I was hoping to enjoy a quality film in the franchise. A movie like Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, Fallout, Top Gun 2 or American Made that you can show to anyone and say these are recent really high quality films starring this guy called Tom Cruise.This is not one of those films.It is more like The Mummy. It is better than Mission Impossible 2 but not better than any of the others in the franchise.","

86,86,/tt9603212,Pjtaylor-96-138044,25 July 2023," This mission of yours is going to cost you dearly.
","'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One (2023)' continues its series' trend of pulling off the impossible by maintaining its quality even as the number of its entries approaches double digits. Despite some early rumblings that this Mission was perhaps not up to the task, I'm happy to report that it's a genuinely enthralling and remarkably entertaining effort from start to finish. While I don't think it's as good as the previous entry (and I certainly wouldn't be able to say it is after having only seen it once), it's right up there with the best of the bunch principally because it's a total blast. Even though the stakes are higher than ever before and it feels as though nothing is off the table, this is a tonally lighter film than 'Mission: Impossible - Fallout (2018)' - as evidenced by Lorne Balfe's bouncier rendition of its theme - and features a number of fairly extended comedic moments to break up the legitimate tension of its more serious segments. Christopher McQuarrie has made each of his efforts feel distinct from one another atmospherically and visually, with this one often having a Brian De Palma vibe (especially in the canted-angle-heavy opening sequence). His penchant for capturing action remains as astonishing as ever, as does his star's willingness to put it all on the line for his audience. Tom Cruise once again blows your socks off with some real-life stunt work that would surely have even the most seasoned stunt person shaking in their boots, but it isn't the movie's most-marketed aspect that necessarily impresses the most here. That's because the other car chases, fist fights and struggles for survival are equally as exciting, if not more so. On top of that, there are several instances of Cruise's classic full-body run to keep that smile that's already on your face there for even longer. There are some truly phenomenal action set-pieces here; even though that's sort of to be expected at this point, it's worth celebrating nevertheless. This is a pulse-pounding, edge-of-your-seat adventure that also makes sure to captivate with its non-action stuff. There are a couple of more traditional story-based set-pieces that centre in on the espionage angle of the narrative, segments which feature suave sleight of hand and despicable double crosses. These are notable because they're just as energetic and enjoyable as a lot of the more bombastic stuff. The narrative itself is perhaps a little loose in places, but it's easy to follow and arguably makes more step-by-step sense than those of the last couple of films. It has veered fully into sci-fi territory, focusing on a sentient rogue AI and the IMF's efforts to destroy it, but the series has always been a little silly and the concept is treated with just enough sincerity that it can be taken seriously (or, at least, as seriously as the filmmakers want you to). The biggest issue with the picture is actually its depiction of its female characters, specifically in how it basically just uses them to motivate its protagonist rather than giving them compelling arcs of their own. I can't really say too much without delving into spoiler territory, but it's a noticeable and disappointing aspect that does dampen some of the flick's narrative success. Still, I can't deny that this is supremely entertaining stuff on the whole. It's an absolute blast that proves the series has yet to run out of steam and is showing no signs of slowing down just yet.","

","Am huge fan of MI franchise. The best part about all MI movies were how they plan and pull off an impossible mission. Thus I am quite disappointed on how this mission never seemed too difficult , let alone impossible.Action was okay. Car chase was funny, but not exciting. Jumping off the cliff seemed forced to me. Why would you keep driving uphill when you can take short cuts to reach the train. It wasn't even a fast train. The key kept being stolen from pockets too many times which makes you wonder how lazy the scripting was. Kill old gf to make new gf was also lazy writing.Unlike other MIs, Ethan had no single smart move or plan. It felt more like let's go and see what happens.Am not sure how MI fans ignored all these weaknesses and gave this film 8+ rating.","

88,88,/tt9603212,BA_Harrison,11 July 2023," Dead stupid.
","Mission Impossible is one of those rare franchises that has been getting better and better with each installment. Until now.The plot can be summed up in a few words -- Ethan Hunt must find a special key to save humanity from an AI entity -- and yet the writers make matters so unnecessarily convoluted that the film winds up at an incredible 2 hours and 43 minutes long, a large percentage of which is far from white-knuckle action. This leads to some serious pacing issues.One of the film's key set-pieces -- a car chase in which Ethan and the newest IMF member Grace (Hayley Atwell) careen about in a yellow Fiat 500 -- is played for laughs, which is at odds with the general tone of the franchise. Roger Moore was just about able to make this kind of nonsense work in For Your Eyes Only (his silly yellow car being a 2CV), but in Dead Reckoning, it's just embarrassing.The deactivation of a bomb by Benji (Simon Pegg) is a pointless piece of padding: he must solve several well-known riddles in order to do so, with seconds to spare at the end. The final piece of the puzzle could easily be solved by simply rotating the last dial through all the remaining options, but that doesn't occur to brainiac Benji. This entire scene could have been cut from the film without detriment.Cruise's much-touted motorcycle jump off a cliff sees Ethan riding his bike at high speed over rough, rocky terrain towards the precipice. I'm no expert, but wouldn't hitting extremely uneven ground at that speed cause him to crash? (in reality, Cruise pelted along a specially constructed, very smooth ramp, the rocky ground added digitally in post).In one of the most ridiculous scenes, Hunt rescues Grace by parachuting through the side of a moving train (this carriage built from balsa wood?), right into a gun toting henchman -- what are the chances?. Equally unlikely is how bad guy Gabriel (Esai Morales) departs from the speeding locomotive: by falling backwards off the train onto a crash mat in a waiting truck, a feat that, realistically, would have less chance of success than me asking Hayley Atwell for a date.And as a graphic designer, I hated the fact that when Grace's various crimes flash up on a laptop screen, each misdemeanour is in a different font and point size. Why would that be a thing? A bored programmer with an interest in typography?Preventing the film from being a total disaster are a great turn by Pom Klementieff as blonde henchwoman Paris, the actress stealing every scene she is in despite having next to no dialogue, and an incredible finale in which Ethan and Grace must race through several of the train's carriages that are dangling over the edge of a bridge, director Christopher McQuarrie reminding us a little too late that he can put together an effective action scene.","

89,89,/tt9603212,jtindahouse,10 July 2023," The most consistent film series around puts out another cracker
","The 'Mission: Impossible' series got so lucky picking Tom Cruise way back in 1996. Not only has he stayed in incredible shape ever since, he's been able to do his own stunts for the movies, adding a sense of realism that films like this otherwise simply can't get. It all makes for an incredible product time and time again. And somehow this series keeps getting better with each installment.The film is long at just under 3 hours, but it doesn't feel that way. It's so jam-packed with action sequences that the time flies by. Just how little down-time there is in this movie is quite incredible. The movie often finds ways of getting information across during action sequences so it doesn't have to do it in-between them, or at least not for as long.Also the story was great. It's a very complex plot device they've chosen to use, however they found a way to keep it extremely simple and easy for the audience to follow with the two keys concept. The film was very cleverly written in that way.This is just everything you'd hope for in an action film. An interesting plot, tonnes of terrific characters filling every scene, great action sequences and set in some beautiful and fascinating locations around the world. This was a really good experience. 9/10.","

","Straight up Dead Reckoning Part 1 was fine. I think it's the weakest out of the last four instalments.I can't put my finger on one exact thing but it just felt a little underdone compared to the last few M:I and was expecting big things the whole movie. It was a combination of things like the acting felt a little weak I guess, the script was just fine, the action was decent but not great compared to other M:I and to the likes of John Wick that I'm now used to. The plot with the A. I is nothing new but it's always still interesting and especially at a time in the real world where the advancements seem to be heating up but the whole pickpocketing the key for 2 hours also got boring so fast. Too many cliches started piling up. The hand to hand combat was some of the weakest stuff I've seen it a while especially the Venice bridge scene, it looked awful, like I could see the choreography. The best scene for me was the desert storm at the start which really had my attention but everything after that seemed just average.I don't know if everyone else is now completely over their only trick being having someone go as someone else with these masks. It's so boring to me now and at a stage I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I really hope the machine blowing a fuse means we have seen the last of them.Tom Cruise is awesome with the stunts he does and will always have respect for the things him doing them but I really wish they didn't show the motorbike cliff jump scene in the trailer. What you see in the trailer is literally the whole stunt, don't get me wrong it's truly impressive but they showed the whole thing and just completely killed it for me.I'm slightly bummed with this one and just coming off seeing Indian Jones and having a lot more fun watching that. I don't care about runtimes but you have to have me sucked in and the whole time, I felt the time...People will love this movie but M:I may have fizzled out with me a bit after this one.","

The film struggles to capture the charm and originality that made the original movie a hit.One of the major letdowns of ""Carry On Jatta 3"" is the lead actress's performance, which is marred by her worst facial expressions. These lackluster expressions fail to convey the humor and emotions necessary for an engaging comedy. It's unfortunate that the film's comedic potential is hindered by such a crucial aspect of the lead actress's portrayal.Furthermore, the humor feels forced throughout the movie, as if the filmmakers were desperately trying to replicate the success of the previous installments. The jokes often fall flat, lacking the natural wit and comedic timing that made the original film so enjoyable. Instead of delivering genuine laughs, the forced comedy feels contrived and uninspired.Additionally, ""Carry On Jatta 3"" fails to bring anything new or innovative to the table, relying heavily on recycled ideas and predictable plotlines. The lack of originality further contributes to the overall disappointment of the film.In conclusion, ""Carry On Jatta 3"" is a wasted opportunity that tarnishes the name of comedy and fails to live up to the charm and brilliance of its predecessors. The forced humor, coupled with the lead actress's poor facial expressions, makes this sequel a regrettable experience for fans of the original. It's best to approach this film with lowered expectations and a willingness to overlook its shortcomings.","

The humour is so bad that throughout the movie, not once did I crack; all the time, it felt like humour was forced. The story is also somewhat the same; only the location and some actors have been replaced by new ones. There were 15 people in the whole theatre to see the show, but that didn't surprise me at all after going through this torture. 2 cans of beer are equivalent to the price I had to pay to see this movie, and after watching it, I wonder how many cans it's going to take me to come out of this state of mind.

","Bro is a 2023 Telugu film starring Pawan Kalyan, Sai Dharam Tej, kethika Sharma, Rohini and many others, directed by Samuthirakani. The movie is a remake ofTamil film named 'Vinodhaya sitham'. Which is directed by Samuthirakani himself.The movie starts with the presence of Sai Dharam Tej, who is playing the role of Markandeya, a manager in a textile industry.Markandeya aka mark always runs behind the time, the time is his daily dose of energy, he wants everything to be done prior. Mark is the only source of income for his family, and these qualities makes him a boomer. While returning from Vizag to Hyderabad by road, he meets with an accident and dies on the spot. This leads meet up with the God of Time ( pawan
Kalyan). Mark is given a chance of 90 days to spend his last days with his family. And to take care of his responsibilities.What all things he can manage in this period and the lessons he learnt during this is the story . Obviously, the self - realisation plays a crucial part in the story. As the time is his sole priority.The movie's duration is 2hrs and 10 mins and in this period, one thing needs to be praised is the presentation of characters and their impact. Everyone were given equal importance. Pawan Kalyan's acting energises the screen. The way he guides mark, shown very properly. But, in order to bring the vintage kalyan vibes, all the makers can do is to add his previous movie's songs and make people cheer to it. If this is what expected by the title vintage, it would be better to re-release all his movies. The movie is filled with his references. These references aren't a part of the plot, the plot is a part in these references, ( to be noted). It even reduces the energy of the music composer to compose songs. These are just meant for his fans. Others can't enjoy the ride. No importance were given to emotions in the first half . And coming to the interval sequence, it was good, but, it didnt make me await for the later half. However, the interval shot is kind of a god level stuff.The second half, is completely plot driven, it builds an emotion between the family. Family problems occur in this period and gets covered or solved within a moment. And these parts were shot rushed and runny. Overall, everything gets resolved and creates an emotional endingThe direction is one of the good things in this film. Dir. Samuthirakani handled the plot himself and presented it in a delicate manner. Sai Tej's performance wasn't as engaging as his other movies does.The sister's roles were just to carry the emotions and they hardly generate gags in few scenesPawan Kalyan's political punches and references are enjoyable to few. But the emotions can be seen and carried by everyone. His costumes brightens the screen.kudos to Neeta Lulla.The lead actress's Ketika Sharma role was not at all fit to plot and the bonding between Tej and Ketika was too filmy.Thaman's compositions fell flat except the bro anthem.Trivikram's involvement makes no change in the screenplay or in the dialogues. The dialogues weren't of his level. Basically, his touch went invisible.Music and dialogues were the drawbacks of the film.Overall, it's a Pawan Kalyan's show and the other characters are the puppets played in his order.its supposed to be watched with family. The family audience might get connected to this emotional entertainer. But didn't serve me this time. Of course, knowing that it's a remake of a straight ott film, it gives the same vibes. The soul of the original missed in this . Yet all I can say at the end is, It's just for the hardcore fans and the families.","

","The Telugu flick ""Bro"" is like a legit redo of the Tamil flick ""Vinodhaya Sitham."" But, let me tell ya, the changes suggested by that idiot Guruji are seriously lame, man. The screenplay got tweaked too, with some silly and cheap masala stuff thrown in, which is just meh.The characters might've been a bit silly in the original, but in this remake, they're downright foolish, ya know? The first half kinda keeps ya interested, but the second half? Boring as hell and way too long, dude.Sai Dharam Tej did his best, but it didn't hit the bullseye. Pawan Kalyan looks stylish, but let's be real, his acting skills ain't that great.Don't even get me started on Ketika. Bramhanandam deserved way more screen time.Some of Pawan Kalyan's costumes are cool, some are just blah. The songs suck, and the background score's alright in a few scenes.The cinematography's decent, I guess. But man, Samudrakhani's direction feels hella clumsy and too influenced by Guruji.I'd say skip this flick, but if you really wanna see it, just wait for the OTT release, bro.","

Except for his antics and those vintage avatars, there's nothing much to write about.Sai Tej looks bloated, physically restrained and acting wise, out of depth, so many scenes with lip sync issues, bad performance. Rest of the cast are just generic and stereotypical.Technically, cinematography by Sujith Vaassudev is good, but letdown by some tacky VFX, editing by Naveen Nooli is okayish, should have trimmed few portions, Thaman's music is disappointing, the songs just act as speed breakers, though the BGM is decent.Writing by Trivikram is subpar, there's good story at hands, only to be marred by half-baked screenplay.Direction by Samuthirakani is average, focussing more on PK, he fails to handle the emotional aspects.Bottom-line: mini meals for Fans, just okayish for others.","

","BRO film has been adapted from a Tamil film called 'Vinodhaya Sitham'. Directed by the same director Samuthirakani, who handled the original, this Telugu film 'BRO' outcome is a mixed bag. To improvise the film on the commercial front, the Telugu version team has overly dependent on power star pawan kalyan's charismatic past. The writing team has compiled all Pawan Kalyan hit songs, and inserted them throughout the film sometimes perfectly syncs with the context, sometimes forcibly. In the first half the theme worked out and appeared entertaining. Pawan Kalyan as TIME shows up in various characters and entertains fans. His costumes and histrionics are of his top-class form. The subtle political flavor dialogues are smartly embedded without being out of place.Positives:Pawan Kalyan Screen Presence
Pawan Hit Songs as a backdrop to a few scenes.Entertainment in the First half
Crisp Run TimeNegatives :Shallow story
Overstuffed fans elements
The original story lost its flavor.","

","Bro movie is different from regular PSPK mass movies - is what I thought. But it is style over substance. Surely it has a better storyline (although not an original) than most Tolly films and a decent screenplay and the kind of direction that suits Telugu audience. Lots of sentimental and comedy scenes. Some plot twists were there which elevated the otherwise clumsy film.Bro has some good moments involving PK (who plays a nameless character that represents time) and Sai Tej who plays 'Mark'. SDT has improved his acting skills over time. Pawan Kalyan isn't known for acting but for his style, which he delivers (albeit with a fake American accent)Vintage PK moments, political dialogues, memes from Telugu pop culture and 90s and early 2000s old music are common. Some people may not like this. Costume design for both actors was very well done although it was noticable more on Pawan Kalyan.1st half was smooth but 2nd half was bit lag. The message in the climax was brilliant. For PSPK fans this is a must watch. Music was decent, bgm was really good.Overall, it is a good attempt (albeit a little clumsy), PK has delivered what he had to (i.e. Style and fan service as usual - don't hope for any serious acting here!) And SDT has done a decent job.Final Verdict: Except for Vintage PSPK fan service moments, it can be enjoyed by anyone as it is a feel good family friendly film. Screenplay and dialogues by Trivikram and Thaman's bgm elevate this film.","

But the best part about Bro is the looks of Powerstar, which are far better than his recent flicks.Sai Dharam Tej gives a decent performance in this fantasy drama. A few scenes between Pawan Kalyan and Sai Dharam Tej came out well, and they will appeal to mega fans. The way Pawan teases Sai Dharam Tej initially is funny.The first half has decent moments which keep the film going. Ketika Sharma does well despite her limited screen presence.

It's not simply that ""Haunted Mansion"" might be too scary for younger kids and too juvenile for older kids, as that would not be a problem if the movie was good or interesting--it's just that this film overall isn't very good or interesting, period.The film follows a single mother and her son who move into the Haunted Mansion, which is in New Orleans. While the film tries to utilize the setting of New Orleans in some decently authentic ways, the rest of the plot and character development is so generic that they fail to make viewers more engaged in the setting. The film's attempts at both humor and scares fall flat, as the jokes are formulaic and corny while the attempts at more frightening moments fail to elicit any tension or suspense, and are quite repetitive and CGI-heavy. For a film that supposedly cost $160 million to make, the visual effects look very cheesy and artificial as well. At over two hours long, the film also runs for too long, especially given the plot has limited resolution or payoff in a way that would be directly satisfying for the audience. While the supporting cast (such as Wilson and DeVito) try their best with the material they have been given and sometimes give off charismatic and fun performances, the rest of the film does not work especially well. Not recommended. 5/10.","

Of course that is all secondary to the most important thing...FUN AT THE MOVIES which is rare these days sadly! It was escapism, great cast, not to mention soooo many easter eggs for fans of the ride. If I'm honest, the 2003 version isn't something I hated like many, but this does it MUCH better. I told my wife when we left, ""if I wanted someone to know what ride they were about to get on at Disney World, I'd just have them watch this and I love the movie for it"".","

","Now this version of Haunted Mansion has some good elements. The Hat Box ghost is the villain, other than just a ghost butler made up for the story. There were lots of great Easter eggs like the wallpaper, the 13th hour clock, the hitchhiking ghosts, & the stretching room - which was honestly a really cool sequence. Though Disney played it safe & excluded Gracey's hanging.Actually, the Gracey storyline is so much weaker in this one compared to how he was a central character in the 2003 film. The 2003 story was honestly much better all around as a tragic haunting love story vs 2023's vengeful spirit with a story of grief.The casts are 50-50 for me. Owen Wilson made me genuinely laugh all through the movie & all the other actors had their own comedic moments that hit. I still like the 2003 cast led by Eddie Murphy, but both casts are fine.Overall, it's a fine film. Though now I wish there was a Haunted Mansion movie that combines everything good from both 2003 & 2023 versions, with 03's music, 23's costume design, and as many Easter eggs to the ride as possible.","

That was a mistake.This movie is not funny. It made me laugh about 4 times. This movie is not scary. I never felt creeped out. I never jumped at any of the numerous poor jump-scare attempts, even in Dolby Cinema where the speakers shake the auditorium. Very little works and there are some extra-cheesy moments.It's a shame, this could have been fun. I like most of the cast. LaKeith Stanfield gives a great performance. There are a few cool scenes and visuals. But I just didn't care. I was not at all invested in the story or characters. And I just wanted it to be over.Maybe it's just me.

144,144,/tt1695843,IonicBreezeMachine,31 July 2023," Second time's the charm with a Haunted Mansion that balances the goofy/spooky tone of the ride to much more successful effect.
","Set in New Orleans, single mother Gabbie (Rosario Dawson) and her son Travis (Chase W. Dillon) move into an old mansion only to find out that it's in fact haunted. Their attempts to leave the house prove futile as the hauntings follow them leading them to turn to help from priest Father Kent (Owen Wilson). After Kent's efforts to exorcise the house prove useless, they enlist the help of former astrophysicist turned tour guide Ben (LaKeith Stanfield) who years ago invented a special camera that could view what was known as the ""ghost particle"" only to be ridiculed out of the academic community. With the helo of Psychic Harriet (Tiffany Haddish) and historical professor Bruce (Danny DeVito) the group attempt to find the root cause behind the hauntings which leads them into the dark history of the house.Haunted Mansion is the latest attempt by Walt Disney Pictures to adapt one of their rides to feature film with Justin Simien serving as director and Katie Dippold credited for writing duties. The film marks the second attempt by the studio to adapt the ride to feature film following the critically maligned but financially successful 2003 adaptation directed by Rob Minkoff and starring Eddie Murphy (neither of whom are particularly proud of the film). Attempts at a new version of Haunted Mansion date back as far as 2010 when Disney began negotiations with none other than Guillermo del Toro to helm a potential adaptation as well as a new label called Disney Double Dare You where Disney and del Toro would produce edgier horror/dark fantasy themed content. Del Toro ultimately left the project citing creative differences with executives feeling his material was ""too dark"" for what they'd envisioned and a new incarnation began in 2020 with Simien and Dippold taking the reins. While I'll always wonder what might've been with del Toro's version, I honestly really enjoyed Haunted Mansion and think critics and audiences have been harder on it than it deserves.In preparation for my viewing of this new incarnation, I actually revisited the 2003 film and I remember being underwhelmed by it upon release and it's only gotten worse with age. Despite being based on one of the most memorable and creative rides at Disneyland, the 2003 film has a curiously flat look, largely skews away from the dark edges in favor of broader more exaggerated deliveries, and features a very stock set of characters complete with a clueless ""workaholic dad"" that Eddie Murphy's talents feel really squandered in. Despite this 2023 update of Haunted Mansion also coming from people with a comedy background, Simien and Dippold don't avoid the darker edges of the material and instead embrace them as well as the slight goofiness of the ride with the film feeling and looking like a horror film but just with some silly things happening every so often that still fit within what you expect of the tone. I really enjoyed the cast in the film with LaKeith Stanfield well cast as the scientifically grounded ""skeptic"" of the group who gets solid pathos as well as entertaining reactions to supernatural shenanigans as the straight man and the relationship he has with Dawson's Gabbie and Dillon's Travis is quite enjoyable especially in how it relates to his own story. We also have some good work done by Owen Wilson, Tiffany Haddish, and Danny DeVito who are all a little silly and quirky, but they still feel like they're taking the situation just seriously enough that it never goes overboard.In terms of faithfulness to the ride I'm happy to say the movie does a solid job of incorporating set pieces and easter eggs you'll remember be it rooms of the mansion or aspects like stretching rooms and we get some nice ""Inception-esque"" room warping and corridor shifts that lend themselves to some fun action beats. I'll admit I'm not as entrenched in Disneyland/World history as certain other people, but I did take someone to this movie who is (longtime friend of 15 years) and he said that it had so many easter eggs he's planning to see it again to catch them all the second time around. People have been critical of Jared Leto's performance as the Hatbox Ghost and I'm honestly not sure why. Granted some of his lines were a little difficult to discern (though that may have just been my theater's audio) but his delivery sounded roughly on par from what I remember of the Disneyland ride so I was satisfied with what I got.I really enjoyed Haunted Mansion and it's probably the most I've enjoyed a film based on a Disneyland attraction since the first Pirates of the Caribbean. Maybe I'm throwing this movie a bit of a bone because I did recently rewatch the 2003 film and I have a soft spot for this kind of comedic spookhouse movie, but if that sounds appealing to you it certainly delivers and will become requisite holiday viewing alongside Hocus Pocus.","

145,145,/tt1695843,wjones-57006,29 July 2023," Another Theme Park Movie Letdown
","The Haunted Mansion has been my favorite Magic Kingdom ride for decades. That made it all the harder to watch another poor attempt at a movie version. It's not terrible, it's just lazy. Disney has had little success with theme park movies, the exception being Pirates of the Carribean. It's like they have just run out of original ideas for their live-action films...even the animated ones are being re-hashed as live ones. It's been few and far between for original ideas from the Mouse House.The script itself is pretty unoriginal. It's a story based on a story from a 50 year old attraction. Add a backstory and a little romance and call it a day. Oh, and don't forget to add in some version of every spooky effect from the ride. Acting ranges from great all the way down to...well...lazy. Most of the cast does an OK job with what they were given. The high end example is Danny DeVito. The man never seems to put less than 110% into whatever he does. At the low end is Rosario Dawson, an otherwise fine actress who looks like she just doesn't want to be in this particular film. She shows little to no emotion even as her world is falling apart. Who knows, maybe that's a directorial decision.FX vary as well. Again, maybe a decision was made to keep them reigned in and not stray too far from the original ride. And then there's the issue with the humor...there hardly is any. I remember really laughing only once along with a few chuckles here and there. And it wasn't just me, the whole theatre was pretty much the same. But perhaps the oddest thing about film was the ridiculous product placement. No physical placement, the confines of the Mansion would have made that look out of place. It was verbal placement. For example, as Harriet organized a seance, she pulls out a notepad and mentions that she bought it at CVS on the way over. What? Who cares where she got it? Costco gets a similar plug as do one or two others.I suppose the movie did what I needed it to do: kill a 95 degree afternoon with popcorn, air conditioning and yes, even a little entertainment. As I said up front, it's not terrible. I just expected better this time around.4 out of 10 stars.","

146,146,/tt1695843,rgkarim,28 July 2023," Haunting Fun, But Busts On Overall Finesse
","LIKES:The Comedy At Times:
-The movie has about three or four layers of laughs to it that should offer variety to the families intending to see it.-One part is silly humor, stumbling, laughing, and slapstick that leads to easy laughs for the little ones to enjoy.-The next one or two is the one liners. One part is quotable madness for the kids, cute, whimsy, fun, and simple, while the other is the grown up words that scratch that itch of nostalgia. It works well when in balance, if not a tad silly as you shall see.-And my level, the sarcasm and sass of the conversation that really hits that situational style with a touch of relevance that in a spooky situation works for the relief. Quite Impressive if I do say so myself.The Easter Eggs:
-It's a movie about a famous ride, and as mentioned Haunted Mansion has layers for the avid rider to seek out.-Disney's self-promotion does pay heed to some classic landmarks to the tale, finding the right designs to bring back the famous ride.-I love nostalgia like this, but what I love even more is the placement and integration of the eggs into the movie, that aren't too over the top or forced in my eyes.-Sometimes it's just a comedic gag, merely paired with a line or two to call attention.-Other times though, it's a story arc or obstacle that I think worked and tried to take the rewritten lore to a level that felt necessary for the plot's direction.The Acting:
-It's a loaded cast and I can't lie, I was impressed with the balance of all these actors having decent time on the screen or use in the story.-Every actor had some moments that were stellar, a great presentation that proved why they joined this supernatural family and joined the mansion's halls.-I'd like to praise all of them, but limited room will keep me to the three top cast alone.-Wilson, is the role he always plays and you know what it works. Levels of serious character development with goofy vagabond work in this complicated manner. That performance may be the same style he presents, but how it drives the story and relieves the darker tones works to a degree.-Dawson is fine when she pulls her moments out, the talented woman has this care and dry humor that feels realistic, fun, if not a bit relevant to the motherly figure. She just needed... well more to let her flex those acting guns she proves she has.-As for LaKeith, the man shows just how talented he is with this level of emotion on the more intense moments that reflect hurt, doubt, depression, and so much more. I felt for his story and the delivery of those moments of someone struggling with something.The Story:
-There are moments in this film where the story goes deep, a level that I think is respectful, exploring emotions perfect for this setting.-It adds a little more flair and adult elements to the movie, makes the film a tad more on the pre-teen than kid level, but really helps add character depth.-The rest of the movie has elements that are in line with the lore of the ride: a mystery element to solve, some horror occult components dialed back to what feels like a theme park ride, and plenty of drama that again works for character moments.-And helping to again respect the lore of the ride in the new medium, is something I have to applaud they were trying for in this movie.The Visuals:
-By far, the movie's visuals and setting reign lord of the manor for this reviewer.-The mansion feels like an expanded version of the ride, the structure, feel, architecture, and more that screams an adaptation of the Haunted Mansion.-Seeing the computer animation moments were certainly exciting, watching the house change, fold, twist and turn to match the agenda of the Hat Box ghost was one of the best moments for me, holding some elements of Dr. Strange magic with it.-The lighting helps to add that enchantment level, an Imagineer creation with more realistic styles that help add the occult atmosphere with the fantasy elements of the park.-Costume gain points for modern and classic styles mixing, bringing to life the complexity of New Orleans, while not being so gaudy or distracting from the things around them that it takes away from the setting.-And the fact that CGI with real life came together in (mostly) fluid visuals and transitions, is bonus points compared to some of the other amalgamations that Hollywood has generated.-The bottom line, the world is created well with the modern twist, binding all the elements together that make it feel like Haunted Mansion.DISLIKES:Rosario Dawson and Curtis' Time:
-Two big actresses, and two big parts, but the time levels did little to reflect what these women are known to bring to their acting game.-Rosario's moments were fine, but her character had more to her I felt, but got kind of lost to the other character traits that her support felt very... lacking. To waste that talent was not my favorite direction, given again the levels of character that could have risen from the grave.-For Curtis, she's funny, she's elaborate, she has the regality at times, an accent that is cheesy, but just fun.-Yet, like Dawson, her involvement is very one note, some forced comedy with a little over the top moments that are charming, sweet, and kid level power, but not really attuning to her full potential.The Comedy Goes A Little Too Silly:
-This is a kids movie and I know family movies have to be silly given the broad range of age and maturity.-Still, the movie sometimes drags out too silly of a movie to relieve the darker elements and the macabre elements they were exploring.-Our actors drop their good performances for very forced bouts of awful running, stumbling words of Whoa, Oh, or Watch Out, that are flat and unbelievable.-And throw in how forced some of the jokes are, going deep into left field that didn't ring well with me or the audience in the room.-It will work for families who just like to giggle and laugh at the simplistic moments, or perhaps more at how their kids get excited seeing these lines.Lazy Design of Some Ghosts:
-I'll say it, Haunted Mansion got lazy about halfway through with the design of the specters that the predecessor did better.-They may have better animation and colors, but what started as creative, unique ghosts with personality in design and a few words, gets lost to generic, ectoplasmic copies that are nothing more than time and money saving.-A shame given again just how many designs they have to play with, but in a world of shrinking budgets, I can't say that seeing it surprised me.Lost Opportunities:
-The Haunted Mansion is a playground of things to explore, do, and help add the thrill to a movie that is reliant on said thrills.-And to a degree they kind of do it, but I can't say the presence of this movie is as strong a haunting as they wanted.-The mystery element is quickly erased by jokes, simple puzzles and solutions that are time conscious, but boring for viewers like me.-A race through the halls, and uncovering truths, gets diluted to comedic plot devices and convenience factors that are cute, funny, but so lackluster to the adventure the other movie did.-The buildup to the end hinted at some wow moments, but by this point it was so wrapped up in the comedic element and family tone that the connection to the world was fading.-A lame attempt at heroics, a standoff that lacked teeth, fighting to end the big bad moment, it all just came out bland, sad, and again designed for a PG level audience to a modern degree.-And the main issue, I think, is that it couldn't get its tone, elements that mixed haphazardly together that held a pale level of involvement that I could just not get a feel for.-It was too many diverse profiles that works for that ""something for everybody"" vibe, but in terms of storytelling, climax, and engaging thrills that the ride does better for me.The VERDICT:
Haunted Mansion is a movie that has a lot of zest and modern wows that make for a fun escape from the realities of the world, sort of. It's elements that make it theater worthy are about the presentation mainly in the characters and the looks. The acting is fine for the most part, only dipping when we get extremely silly and forced tones that they don't seem ready to act out. As for the visuals, they are the things bringing the dead ironically to life. The way they pay homage to the ride, but warp it in this fantastic Disney vibe of spooky works very well to be entertaining and fun. However, the movie fails to live up to the full potential of the trailers for me, mainly in not being able to balance the feel and the genres in a manner that works in tandem. Trying to be for the family, but still be spooky and thrilling just don't mesh well and left me bored and wanting more given the setup of the film. All the elements I liked seemed to be working towards something, but then got snuffed out in some rush towards a hasty end to the budget. The result... the movie just felt a shade of what it could have been given the Disney of old. All of this comes together so that the séance of spookiness is rated as:Comedy/Drama/Family: 7.0
Movie overall: 6.0.","

","The new Disney film based on the Haunted Mansion ride at Disneyland features key elements from the ride, including Easter eggs paying tribute to its inspiration. This is Disney's third attempt at bringing the ride's spooky charms to the screen, following 2003's Eddie Murphy starrer and 2021's enjoyable Muppets Haunted Mansion streaming special. However, the film falls short of the laughs and scares needed for a potential blockbuster franchise like the Pirates of the Caribbean series. The film's potential improvement could have been made if Guillermo del Toro had remained creatively involved. The film directed by Justin Simien is a routine summer entertainment suitable for less discerning youngsters. Screenwriter Katie Dippold infuses emotions into the proceedings, with a central character haunted by memories of his deceased wife. The poignant subplot blends with trademark apparitions like The Hat-Box Ghost and Madame Leota's disembodied head. Ben, a skeptical mansion visitor, becomes a believer when ghosts follow him home to his rundown French Quarter house. He temporarily lives with Harriet, a psychic medium, and Bruce, a professor specializing in haunted houses. The production designers and special effects team recreate the thrills and chills of a theme park attraction using a visually dazzling combination of CGI and practical effects. However, the running time of over two hours makes the experience feel like riding the same ride repeatedly. The film lacks memorable cameos, with actors like Curtis and Leto barely affecting the story. Stanfield and Dawson lack the comic chops to make their characters more than plot devices. DeVito, Haddish, and Wilson perform better, with DeVito's mellow line readings contrasting with the visual mayhem. However, these comedic pros cannot salvage lame jokes like DeVito's ""I'm too old to die!"" joke while being manhandled by aggressive spirits. ""Haunted Mansion"" is a visually striking film inspired by the popular Disneyland ride, with elements like stretching rooms, hitchhiking specters, and subtle references like Harriet's chair. The filmmaker uses physical and special effects to create a world that feels lived in for the ensemble of people and frights, while also capturing a New Orleans atmosphere with funeral processions and brass bands. Rosario Dawson plays Eddie Murphy's haunted mansion owner, but underutilizes the role in a regulation Mom role. Jamie Lee Curtis portrays Madame Leota, but struggles with her disembodied head and lacks Jennifer Tilly's memorable performance. Jared Leto's Morbius cheekbones are CGI-worked, but the funhouse illusion of impossible geometries doesn't dispel the feeling of déjà vu.","

","I wasnt sure what to expect this time around. This would be the 3th Disney Ride (that I'm aware of) turned into a movie, and the first of those to be a reboot.I was pleasantly surprised by this film. It managed to almost perfectly encapsulate a 10 minute ride and turn it into a believable plot/story that makes coherent sense. While I wished they would have focused more on some elements of the ride that people recognized, there was enough there to fully feel like they thought this out. Unfortunately this means I have been humming that darn Haunted Mansion theme in my head for a couple of days.The cast the chose definitely felt like an oddball cast. It really feels more like a '7 random strangers stuck get in the wild' type cast, and ultimately thats what it ended up being, but they worked well together. Everyone one of them were able to bring the laughs, while a few of them managed to get me to feel real emotions. I do think some of the 'cameos' felt under utilized, especially Jamie Lee Curtis, but overall, it made of a fun group.What this movie managed to do the best was create a story that almost perfectly captures the essences felt from the Haunted Mansion Ride. One part haunting, 1 part excited, 1 part thrilling, and 1 part mysterious.The one thing that felt off about the movie was its pacing. It would go from thrilling haunted adventure, to detective work quite often. At one point they feel like they are trapped inside a haunted house with no escape, then at another point I feels like they are just hanging out in a news room looking up history books. The movie would go from this haunted house immersion to every day society almost too often, But the final act of the movie fully went all in on the haunted mansion.I would definitely put this movie in the family fun category. If you feel comfortable enough taking your kids on the Haunted Mansion Ride, this definitely for them. The movie definitely deals with some mature elements like death and grief, but it manages to handle it in a way thats understandable. The movie brings together a comedic cast, and throws them into the mysterious haunted mansion in a cheesy and fun filled way.While I definitely think this movie will be a 1 off, I could see this becoming a cartoon, Disney+ series, or spawn some straight to Disney Plus sequels. It was definitely enjoyable and left you wanted to live in this world a bit longer.Ignore the review bombing.","

I really don't understand people's hate for Jared Leto and Morbius. Morbius was a lot better than this movie. Speaking of waiting for things, I was waiting for them to really dive into the ride references, but they skimmed big time. Maybe there is some legal reason they weren't able to use more lines from the dialogue in the ride, but I was not satisfied with their apparent lack of substantial references and iconic music. It was spritzed in here and there, but not at the level it should've been at. The humor was more dry than actually funny, and I don't think they could've put together a less compelling story, outside of the surface level idea of Haunted Mansion as we know.The performances from the cast weren't bad enough to make me want to leave the theater, but the chemistry between Ben and Gabbie was non existent. Most of the emotional moments in the film felt empty, and I had a hard time finding a reason to care about anything that was going on. There were still a couple Easter Eggs they threw in there like the stretching ceiling and long hallway, but overall felt like it had no self awareness. This is the unfortunate side effect of really bad writing. They had the cast, they had the set design, but the writing was a huge miss.Shoutout to the legendary Kurt Yue once again for ending up in this film as a Police Officer. It fills my heart every single time I see him book roles. He deserves everything he gets and more. Give my man some lines and a more important role!","

","Walt Disney movies were my absolute favorite growing up. I have fond memories of all of them and watched Mickey Mouse Club every day, as well as Walt Disney Presents and later, Walt Disneys Wonderful World of Color on Sunday nights. Over the last twenty or so years, they seem to have lost their way and a few recent movies I've seen have been big disappointments. They seemed like predictable, cynically calculated products created by committees and focus groups rather than by creative artists who love making movies and bringing delight and positive moral and ethical lessons to children.I attended a showing of Haunted Mansion with lowered expectations, especially since I was not a fan of the Eddie Murphy version. However, from the first moments I was captivated by this new version. The cast was excellent and the special effects well executed. LaKeith Stanfield was excellent in the lead and Tiffany Haddish,as a medium was a riot! Owen Wilson is always enjoyable, as is Danny DeVito and the rest of the cast. It was fun to look for the pieces that referred to the ride and to watch the funny stuff happening in the background.I hope this movie does well for Disney so they are encouraged to make more movies like this. This was a pleasant way to spend a couple hours in an air conditioned theater during a heat wave.","

I was surprised at some of the cameos. It was a fun addition.The story and casting work well together. I appreciated how the film incorporated a cohesive story rather than a series of scenes that felt like you were on a ride.There are moments I laughed and some scenes might make you tear up.

","The Haunted Mansion (2023) is a movie that my daughter and I watched in theaters tonight. The storyline follows a single mother and her son who decide to move from the city to a mansion just outside of New Orleans. Little does she know the house is haunted. She brings in a priest to deliver an exorcist, a medium, a man who developed a special camera lens that can see ghosts and a professor that writes books on hauntings. Together they hope to free the spirits of the mansion so the single mom and her child can live in peace.This movie is directed by Justin Simien (Dear White People) and stars LaKeith Lee Stanfield (Selma), Jamie Lee Curtis (Halloween), Danny DeVito (Drowning Moana), Rosario Dawson (Deathproof), Tiffany Haddish (Girls Trip), Winona Ryder (Edward Scissorhands), Jared Leto (Requiem for a Dream) and Owen Wilson (Wedding Crashers).This movie has a fairly straightforward primary storyline with some creative and well written subplots that unfold well. The husband/wife and father/son subplots were deeper than I expected. The cast is awesome and everyone delivers a solid performance, especially DeVito who was hilarious. New Orleans was an obvious great setting for this picture. The horror elements are top notch and ""clean,"" as you'd expect from Disney. The CGI was fantastic and there were even some creative jump scares. This has an expected Disney ending.Overall, this is a fun family horror movie that's worth a watch. I would score this a solid 6/10 and strongly recommend it.","

Director Justin Simien has given us a movie that is a perfect tribute to the beloved Disney theme park ride of the same name. This film is hilarious from time to time but, it could have been absolutely hysterical with the talented cast that they assembled. The PG-13 rating diminishes the scares & makes sure you don't really get spooked about by the titular mansion's machinations. This is definitely a missed opportunity. The set pieces are awesome.

Owen Wilson is amazing as Father Kent. Tiffany Haddish is fantastic as Harriet. Danny DeVito is phenomenal as Bruce Davis. Chase Dillon is excellent as Travis. The supporting cast is unforgettable.

This is not a movie where you can turn your brain off. I watched a dubbed version, so I could not tell if the issue was the translation or not, but I suspect the story arc was complex. The character arcs were in character and great. It was really good to see Shinya Kôgami back again, Kôgami and Akane are my favourite characters.At one stage I though the movies had gone on too long, but that was only for a moment and when they launch he final assault it was intense.

After she knows what the system is in the first season, she said one day the system will shut down when people find a way to replace you, but now we still need you. In this movie Akane said there is a role for the system, but it needs a coexist power to control it. She knows the system is not good, but she understands how important the system is for everyone. She didn't want to abolish it, but kept looking for a way to restraint it. In the end Akane sacrificed her self to preserve the legal system.

","Sathyanathan is about one who always tells the truth, but due to his flaws in character he is crucified. His major flaw is loose tongue and being over smart. His leaked audio tapes are supposed to be a result of his loose tongue rather than his actual involvement. He is such a sweet guy who would never do it because he is Sathyanathan. Pan-Indian obsession is also present in the film in a form that could be thought out in Sathyapurshotaman's regular films. Major Ravi would have been better for the NIA Officer's role and for creating credibility of association that the film sought. Sathyapurshothman seems like he has gone through a lower eyelid lift to slide back as a lovely image in the heart's of mass followers. Apart from the subliminal messaging, it's an okay story with an ample opportunity to feast on the actor's yesteryear antics and talents, and without any cheap double entendres. Last-time, a version of it was in Bro Daddy. The image's in the opening credits seemed like the film was meant for someone else and then it was repurposed, it seemed like a whitened out Manoj K. Jayan. Film was made into a perfect brand carrier, heavy subliminal messaging from the beginning to end, planned success celebrations started even before the film was properly launched and staged interview moments alongside with fans from all ages was a good show. It feels like Sathyapurshothman has successfully tested the waters and can sign up for new films without any worries. This is legendary power-play, something political parties should learn on how to mold a positive narrative even after conducting any publicly disfavoring deeds. A pleasant thing witnessed in the film was involving some semi-forgotten actors and actresses back onto the big screen.","

","Satyaprem ki Katha or SKP is supposed to be a romantic film but it actually carries a very serious topic for discussion.The film starts off very average with some poor comedy scenes and some forgettable dance numbers but after 30 mins , the film starts to sail and sails at full speed revealing some shocking facts about Katha.Let's talk about how maturely the director has churned out this sweet romantic film. The film never jumps to kissing or such things but very slowly and steadily and very carefully moved the romantic track forward and knowing the story of Katha , this kind of treatment is very mature and needed. A blank faced Kiara slowly and steadily shifts to a more happy joyful faced Kiara and the transition is done beautifully!!!Dealing with the story of Katha, SatyaPrem aka Sattu also is handed a very mature character, never really jumping to doing odd stuff but makes sure he slowly and steadily and carefully takes steps forward in comforting and solacing Katha and this is where the beautiful chemistry arises between them that never never never felt forced but comes naturally and you start to get invested in their love story . Kudos to Sameer Vidhwans for handling this sensitive romantic film so well. These days romantic films have a tendency to jump too quickly to adult scenes but not this one. FOR THE LOVE STORY AND THE SERIOUS TOPIC , KUDOS TO THE MAKERS!!However, it's not perfect. The comedy is a hit and miss especially the dysfunctional comedy in the first 30 mins. Few comic sequences later do make you grin but overall, i felt these sequences could have been reduced and hence reduce the overall running length of the film. The songs are the biggest negative point imo. They are placed badly , and yeah, the nightmare is true, Pasoori Nu is actually present right inside the film and doesn't fit the sequence where it is presented at all. You see a film like Akash Vaani where there was a similar sequence in the snow with the beautiful song Padh Gaye Ji and it suited the sequence so well. Wished a similar kind of song was present in that sequence in this film. Also, the climax , the Puja sequence, very poorly ended!! It almost felt the film was about a start a new chapter (or rather you would feel the climax is about to start there ) and to my utter disappointment, the film actually ended there (meaning it was not the start of the climax but the end of the film there) !! A courtroom sequence would have done so much more justice to the ending instead of an abrupt ending.Performance. Kiara Advani is the star of the show . Her transition from a depressed lady to a happy joyful comfortable lady is just flawless. She nails the emotional scenes in this film. Next is Kartik who handles a mature character very well and brings in the natural innocence he brings with every such character he plays . His transition from being a zero to a hero is commendable. His scenes with Kiara are so beautiful and heartwarming. Gajraj rao shares a terrific chemistry with Kartik .Overall, SKP is a must watch. I don't know how you guys tolerated TJMM but SKP is a million times better than that film in terms of chemistry and love angle.","

","Satyaprem Ki Katha (2023) :
Movie Review -Sameer Vidwans brings a sensitive love story, ""Satyaprem Ki Katha,"" with Kartik Aaryan and Kiara Advani. The romantic genre doesn't get many pure films anymore in Bollywood. The last of those quality romantic dramas were ""Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi"" and ""Veer Zaara"". It's been more than a decade now since we have seen a classic romance because nobody actually has enough sense to catch the nerve of the genre. Nowadays, it's all about taboos, and sometimes it works too, but the outcome is never supposed to become a timeless tale. Sameer Vidwans, who has directed an atrangi romantic comedy like ""YZ,"" has a taboo breaking concept again that he attempts to mould into a family-friendly and crowd-pleasing entertainer. But what a big mess he has created, and what immature flaws in the screenplay that lack even a basic sense.Satyaprem, aka Sattu (Kartik Aaryan), is a typical Gujju bachelor who is desperately waiting for his Baydi (wife) but isn't getting one. On one fine Navratri evening, he sees a cracker of a girl, Katha (Kiara Advani), and falls in love with her. Katha, however, clarifies that she is in a relationship with someone. Sattu is ready to wait, and his wait ends after a year when he saves Katha from a suicide attempt. It's an arranged marriage for them, which starts off with a little hesitation from both sides. However, their language is quite bold and bindass-not just them two, but the entire family. That's where the film starts drowning as the logic begins to fade. Katha reveals that she is asexual, but let me warn you that this isn't the 'big suspense' the team has kept hidden for months. There are plenty more twists, deceptions, and conflicts waiting for you that will turn this romantic drama-cum-family drama into a sensitive social film.SPKK starts off like ""Jab Me Met,"" then turns into the ""Highway"" zone and ""Shubh Mangal Saavdhan"" and finally ends up being ""Pink"". Karan Sharma has gone through all films and taken a piece from each to create his own original script. However, Satyaprem Ki Katha gets nowhere as it fails to make its identity stand out. The first big flaw is Kiara's so-called taboo secret, which is totally illogical. Why would an asexual girl ever engage in an affair with a guy when she knows that she isn't capable of carrying it along? The second big flaw is child-abuse hints that are quickly turned into normal, while the first impression clearly states it as ""No, daddy no."" What was that, then? A father-son duo having an open discussion about every funny thing suddenly starts hiding normal things like 'rape'? We read it every day in the newspaper and see it on news channels; then what's so taboo about it? The climax is a wholesome disaster put together, as Tapan's arrest is absolutely senseless. How can someone prove a rape case in court after a year? It's common sense, man, that you need to go through a medical test within 24 hours to prove it. How can one mess this basic thing up? SPKK is nothing but multiple taboos coming together to create a mess, and it's a damn lengthy one like your daily soaps.One good thing about Kartik Aaryan is that he is not getting typecast like he used to before the pandemic. Dhamaka, Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2, Freddy, Shehzada, and now Satyaprem Ki Katha, he has at least kept variety in his roles. Sattu's smile is irritating sometimes, but defining a man is what everyone's going to love. I would not forgive him for keeping his trademark ""Problem ye hai ki..."" monologue incomplete for the second time this year. Kiara Advani's breathtaking moves start winning you over from her very first appearance, but later on she starts getting repetitive. I was like, I have seen this face and these expressions before in ""Jugjugg Jeeyo"" and ""Good Newwz"". Supriya Pathak hasn't been used well when there is so much scope for her character. She was the lady of the house and could have gone with some hard-hitting one-liners on her husband, but alas, they didn't realise her potential or her character. Gajraj Rao and Siddharth Randeria are fine as typical fathers, while Rajpal Yadav (that terrible first frame of him bum), Shikha Talsania, Bhumi Rajgor, Bhaumik Ahir, and Nirmiti Sawant don't have enough screenspace.Musically, Satyaprem Ki Katha is a winner, even though the timing of the songs isn't quite right. Naseeb Se, Gujju Patakha, Sun Sajni, and Aaj Ke Baar are good, while Pasoori is hardly decent. The cinematography and choreography of the songs are lavish and gorgeous. All the songs have good lyrics, too. If there is any misfire, then it has to be the film's editing. 146 minutes for this big mess.. Who approved it? Having 15 minutes of one daily episode cut down might have left me less angry. Sameer Vidwans started off with atrangi ""YZ"" and then went on to make a classic like ""Anandi Gopal"" (his best work ever and is likely to remain so), then again went down with chaotic ""Dhurala"". He couldn't get over Dhurala's mess with Satyaprem Ki Katha, I feel. This time on a larger scale and with a bigger budget, that's the only difference. It's quite funny that two films on the importance of Sex in Marriage life-having two completely opposite directions-are coming on the same day. Lust Stories Chapter 1 says, ""Sex is the key to a happy marriage,"" and Satya Prem Ki Katha tells, ""Sex is not the key to a happy marriage."" Coincidentally, both don't make much sense after all. Overall, SPKK is a wannabe social and good film trapped in a messy screenplay. I wish they had been aware of their own motives. Feminism, manhood, sexual trauma, social taboos, romance, comedy, and family drama-it was just too much for one film with no senior face.RATING - 4/10*","

",Wow. This movie isn't what anyone expects it to be. I just loved how the movie changes genre with one twist mid way through the movie. Such a thought provoking drama disguised as a rom com. It will certainly not be an easy watch for anyone who is expecting a cute romantic comedy but will delight anyone who wants to see something new and relevant.This is perhaps Kiara's best acted movie and even Karthik Aryan who is his usual self in the first half raises his game in the second half of the movie. Supriya Pathak is delightful in the movie and Gajraj Rao gives another terrific performance. The story is completely fresh and the direction of such a sensitive topic is masterful.

","We've heard many stories like this before even seen in many movies of how the pain that women suffers and go through with it by not telling anyone and by doing that thing the culprit will easily ran away. This is the whole narrative of the film.But the way director has presented this story is worth watchable. From started the movie takes up the pace slow by building it's characters and not revealing the secrets. This type of screenplay what I like about when you feel the tension that what is the secret that the film is not telling to the audience and when the secret revealed that moment was mesmerising where you can easily connect with the characters and felt their emotions throughout the film.Kartik & Kiara deserves a thumbs up for their incredible performances, specially in emotional scenes both were outstanding.There's also one man that I have to mentioned in the supporting role and he supported the film really well name is Gajraj Rao as always superb performance and what an artist he is specially in father role he is really suitable. Music is superb of this film every song has a connection to the characters and it has place right at that moment where it should be.You can say after a long time we have seen a musical bollywood romance film with a proper story and performance.Must watch for 1 time for it's story, songs and emotional scenes......","

","Satyaprem ki katha is a musical romantic comedy drama film directed by sameer vidwans.Kartik aaryan has given a great performance here. He still has room for improvement, especially in the scenes where he needs to breakdown and shed a tear or two. In this film, it looked like he was trying too much to cry which should have been more organic. Kiara advani, though, hits it out of the park. She is a tremendous dramatic actress. It was evident here throughout. The scene, where she outbursts in her trauma is excellent. She is one of the few actresses that look more beautiful while crying. She is extremely pretty. Gajraj rao, supriya pathak and the supporting cast are good.The screenplay in the first half was good, but i hoped for it to be much better. The comedic gags, worked in some places but looked out of place in many scenes. The songs seemed to elongate the first half. The placement of the song 'le aaunga' is bad. The second half, in comparison, and in general, is the main hero of the film. The conflict point and the drama building is very good. The social context, the ignorance is shed light upon. The acting performances, go one notch up.The music and background score is very good. The songs are melodious and power packed, respective of their genre. 'Le auunga' and 'aaj ke baad' are two great romantic numbers. The garba songs too are very good. The chemistry between kartik and kiara work big time. This pair will work wonders in the upcoming years. I would have liked for the film to go deeper into the subject of date rape, the knowledge of base and all, but it still provided a very vivid commentary to the matter. And that itself elevates it from just a rom-com to something that you will remember.The cinematography is good. Specially one shot, after katha comes out with her trauma, satyaprem tries to confront her and talk to her but he cannot. The use of light and the two persons beyond and in front of the door make up for a really good scene.","

","As an avid movie enthusiast, I have had my fair share of cinematic disappointments, but none quite compare to the abomination I recently witnessed: ""Satyaprem Ki Katha."" This film, if it can even be called that, is an utter catastrophe from start to finish.From the very beginning, it becomes painfully evident that the creators of this movie had no idea what they were doing. The plot is nonsensical and disjointed, leaving viewers puzzled and questioning the purpose of the story. It jumps haphazardly from one poorly executed scene to another, lacking any coherence or logical progression.The writing is nothing short of atrocious. The dialogue is cringe-inducing, filled with clichés and laughably bad one-liners. It's as if the script was penned by an amateur with no understanding of character development or meaningful storytelling. The attempts at humor fall flat, leaving the audience in a state of disbelief rather than laughter.The acting is equally horrendous. The cast delivers wooden performances, devoid of any emotional depth or believability. It feels as though the actors themselves are embarrassed to be associated with such a train wreck of a production. The lack of chemistry between the characters further highlights the film's overall incompetence.The visual effects, or lack thereof, are nothing short of laughable. The CGI is poorly rendered, looking like something out of a low-budget video game from the early 2000s. It's clear that the filmmakers cut corners in this department, resulting in scenes that are unintentionally comical rather than visually impressive.Furthermore, the cinematography and editing are amateurish at best. The camera angles and framing choices are inexplicably odd, often leaving important details out of frame or focusing on irrelevant elements. The editing is choppy and inconsistent, adding to the overall confusion and frustration.The film's soundtrack is forgettable and unremarkable, failing to enhance or elevate any of the already lackluster scenes. It's as if the music was an afterthought, thrown together without any consideration for how it would complement the visuals or evoke any emotional response from the audience.In conclusion, ""Satyaprem Ki Katha"" is undoubtedly the worst movie I have ever had the misfortune of watching. Its incoherent plot, cringe-worthy dialogue, abysmal acting, laughable visual effects, and overall lack of artistic merit make it a true disaster in the world of cinema. Save yourself the agony and avoid this film at all costs.","

Kartik is improving himself by every movies and it's not an exaggeration if I would say that Kiara advani should be counted among the mature actress now coz she has delivered her best in this .Gajraj Rao , Supriya Pathak and a Lil bit of Rajpal Yadav constitute the perfect supporting cast one could ask for .If you want to be appreciated especially in Bollywood and that too with the cover of love story which is in plenty of supply over here you must have some unique n fresh content and these guys possess that .Situation matters most to audience and these guys depicted it classically i mean songs , dialouges , comedy , emotion , tragedy , romance everything in Accordance to situation.Screenplay could have been better because in second half somewhere it is felt that this movie is Lil bit stretched.I have seen many media channels n reviewers are applauding Samir vidwans the director but beware that he is Marathi , made a gujrati film in Hindi so don't expect some Raju hirani 's masterclass from him but yes he did a fantastic job .All n all I can say that if you are planning a worthy weekend with family, are a Karthik Kiara fan, wanna watch a fresh rom com in Bollywood then this is for you .Thank you !!","

Pairing-wise, this duo is a sureshot winner.Music plays a key role in enhancing the storyline's impact. My fav is ""Aaj ke baad"" though I also liked naseeb se, gujju patakha, and pasoori (I don't see the need of slamming the remix though, because it's made peppy instead of the longing and solitude-type vibe of the original pasoori).A tight script and screenplay, crisp (and sometimes funny) dialogues, and sharp editing are strong points of the film though a little less preaching in the second half would have helped.All in all, this is a movie worth watching in the theatres.

","Well guys... despite me really looking forward to this new installment in the franchise and an overall excitement for what was to come... I must say I was generally disappointed. This series started on a high note with a steady decline in quality and intrigue but never landed below average. Each one brought something seemingly new and different to the table... this one, however, I cannot say the same about.This was essentially just a retelling of the first story but 9 years later. Like, truly guys, it was pretty much the same. I kept waiting and waiting to feel like something was happening. Something interesting, something new or exciting... really, just anything besides a jump scare. All of a sudden I was over 2/3s of the way through and the story was just not delivering. It rounded out being a bit of a bore as far as action/plot went.The production was also greatly hindered in my opinion by other variables such as script, acting and characters. The script was... poor. It felt like an amalgamation of every cliché line and trope you have ever heard in a horror movie put into one script. I audibly laughed at certain lines because they were just too much to handle lol.Also the characters were just plainily not super relatable or enjoyable. The dad was just a little too pathetic to where it was a bit cringe, the son was so much of that ""irritable, bratty teenager"" that it was irksome... and don't get me started on that TIRED, cliche character of the ""quirky random stranger that is blunt, pushes comfort zones and becomes best friends with the main character in 12 hours"". I think between the script and the characters... the actors didn't have all that much to work with, but if I had to make a blanket statement regarding that, I would say the acting was unsuccessful.Despite these faults, I wouldn't say that this was entirely unsuccessful as a whole. Being a fan of this universe, it was nice to see these characters, monsters and plots revisited. There were some genuine scares and solid spook factor despite them primarily relying on jump scares. Unfortunately I just don't think they really pushed this in creating something new, fun, fresh and original. I found myself exiting the theater asking myself ""why""... like what was their goal in making this, what was their point. I'm giving this a 4.5 rounding down to a 4. It wasn't awful, but as far as recommendation goes I don't think you're missing out on much if you pass on it.IG - howlingatthemoonreviews.","

","There is nothing special about this movie storyline that you are going to miss so I highly advise you to watch this at home when it comes out online because you will be highly disappointed just like I was. My wife and I watched first two parts again before planning to go for this one and we were very excited. However, I didn't like the trailer and had low hopes because part 3 and part 4 were not that good and I actually think that lambert story ended pretty well in part 2 so there was no need to make another part on them. This movie is highly disappointing and pointless. After all the characters went through , the wife divorces the husband. And the kid he saved has so much of attitude and hates his father. Its all messed up, right. Cali who was always left alone by the mother in first two part is only seen once in this movie so the director also forgot about her. The little brother also doesn't have much screen time. The movie focuses on Dalton and josh relationship which is not going well. There are only few jumpscares and the first jumpscare comes very late in the movie when its almost 40 mins in the movie. The movie is only mysterious for the characters and not for the audience because we already know what happened with them so it is really pointless that only until the end they remember what happened with them and this is no surprise for the audience. Story of josh father was also useless, there was nothing special about it and why would he haunt him and try to kill him , this is so stupid. I thought at the end they will get the courage to face their demon and fight it but once again they were just easily running away from it. And in the end, Dalton cowardly left his father holding the door all by himself and the end reveals that it is only because of the stupid red door painting that this all came back to haunt them so what he does is just paint it black to close the door, that's it and the movie ends .

","There's a sound -- a nearly imperceptible sigh -- that my wife makes when a film displeases her. I've heard it, sitting next to her in quiet theaters and I know that I don't even have to ask if she liked the movie.During this film, I heard it more than a few times.As someone who mainly loves either drive-in era movies, foreign horror or films out to test the audience's gag reflex with a torrent of upsetting scenarios and body decimation, it took some time for me to begrudgingly respect the ghost and possession cycle of James Wan, starting with 2010's Insidious, followed by 2013's The Conjuring and then alternating each year or so between these franchises. Both of these series are marked by his quality eye for direction as well as some truly well-delivered art direction, something that's lacking in so many modern horror movies.But as it goes, franchises get stale. The Conjuring will hit nine movies this fall -- and two shorts -- while this is the fifth Insidious film. Created by Leigh Whannell (who also worked on Saw and Dead Silence with Wan and directed the underappreciated Upgrade), the first two films center on Josh and Renai Lambert (Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne) and their children Dalton, Foster and Cali. They're, as usual in long franchises, the best in the overall series.A review, for those that haven't seen the film: Dalton encounters an entity in the attic of the family home and goes into a coma, but is truly trapped in a realm past life and death called The Beyond, err, The Further. That very same place nearly trapped Josh when he was a child, a fact that he learns from his mother Lorraine (Barbara Hershey), and required the help of psychic Elise Rainier (Lin Shaye). Now, she must come back, along with paranormal investigators Specs and Tucker (Whannell and Angus Sampson), and figure out how to rescue the Lambert family.The events of this movie -- and the second, which was predestined based on the shock ending of the original -- run deep within every moment of this reimagining/sequel/restart of the franchise, the first film of the series in seven years.Spoilers for everything after the trailer...Directed by Wilson and written by Scott Teems -- more on him in a bit -- this movie opens on tragedy. Lorraine has died, Josh and Renai have divorced, Dalton (Ty Simpkins, who was played the role in the original, as is Andrew Astor as Foster) and his father are distant and it seems like Josh has spent the last few years in what he calls a fog. Even an attempt at connecting by driving Dalton to college fails.While there, the young artist goes through a memory exercise in class and unlocks memories of The Further, drawing the red door at the entrance. Along with his roommate -- by accident, she's played by Sinclair Daniel and is accidentally placed in his dorm -- he begins to investigate his ability to astral project and avoid ghosts at frat parties. There is a cute scene where both Specs, Tucker and Elaine all appear on YouTube.Meanwhile, Josh attempts to discover why he's felt like he's lost most of his life. Between a CAT scan gone jump scare and a memory game -- also gone jump scare -- he finally has to go talk to his ex-wife and learn that he once menaced the entire family with a hammer while possessed by Michelle Crane, the Woman In White, as well as the Lipstick Demon.Now, those same entities have trapped Dalton -- cue the red room, start up ""Tiptoe Through the Tulips"" and start the fog -- and father must save son.The issue with this movie is in what you want it to be. Do you want closure for a family that has dealt with the paranormal and blocked it out of their lives until the act of forgetting it split them? Or do you want a scary film that takes ordinary people into the frightening unknown of The Further? This film series has always dealt with loss and grief and the missing spaces caused by those gone from our lives -- Josh's father, Elaine's husband -- but this goes further (pardon the pun) by spending nearly an hour in the miserable lives of a family that has failed to connect before it seemingly remembers that oh yes, this is also a possession movie.Wilson does fine for a first-time director, but it's a tough walk emulating the footprints of Wan. I watched the original right after we got home from the theater and it's striking how much bigger and richer the first movie is. As for the script, well, Scott Teems has somehow gotten to write a Firestarter reboot, the excoriable Halloween Kills and is now set to write The Exorcist: Believer, all based on a few shorts and some TV work, as far as I can tell. The height of his wit is named a character Nick the Dick after a scene in Bachelor Party and really that's the limit of creativity in a film that outright restages scenes from the second movie.This is less a movie that is out to scare you as a summer thrill ride and more one that brings closure to a family constantly dealing with decades of missing people and trying to process grief. The film that it wants to be is not always compatible with the type of movie it is sold as. It needs defter hands to pull that off and instead, we are like the characters in The Further, wandering the fog for 90 minutes or so until the lights come on and we can finally go home.PS: There was a man literally screaming out things while we watched this movie, frightened by almost every jump scare and he wasn't joking. I hope that if you see this movie he's in the audience with you, because he's the best part of the film.","

I just wish he would have done it more often.The story does find good reasons to exist-to continue this long-delayed franchise. It explores themes of memory that feel like a natural continuation of the Lambert's story. And it culminates in an emotionally satisfying ending.It's just that the script too often falls upon stilted, unnatural dialogue and is paced without a sense of progression, and it makes this movie a lot less effective and memorable than it could have been with the many good ideas on display.","

The cinematography does a good job, especially with chiaroscuro. The editing is dizzying and accentuates the suspense.

","Apparently, audience are divided between liking it and otherwise. For me, personally, this directorial debut effort by Patrick Wilson is a missed opportunity at its best. I find Insidious 5 to be rather boring and weak. It was at all that scary as compared to the original. It played on the cliched tropes of horror movie jumpscares.Now I know it's a completely unfair comparison to distinguish both films. But the narrative seemed to be rather convoluted throughout. I could really feel the strenuous link between Josh's and his son's, Dalton, storyline.Yet to be perfectly fair, kudos to Patrick Wilson for helming this project. I mean, one would regard that being one of the primary characters in this franchise, Wilson would have a firm ground on what to conjure up (no pun intended) from his experience doing the first two Insiduous. Yet, the result was a mish-mash of trying to link this one to the first two. At least, Insiduous: Chapter Two felt consistent enough for audiences to appreciate the sequential continuity to the events in the first movie.But Insidious 5 felt very disjointed to say the least. And on top of that being a singer too, I guess Wilson couldn't help but performed the end credits song too. Patrick Wilson, is no doubt an excellent actor. But to perform his own rendition of the classic Shakespeare's Sister's hit could be regarded as being vain. It's as if he's doing it for his own personal vanity project.","

","Im just mixed feelings about that movie to be honest. For the first hour of the movie, i didnt stopped wondering why they did that movie? What the purpose? The story feel illogical: they tried everything in the previous movie to forget and now they need to remember?For what reason? And i was kind of sad to see that the mother have just some few moments in the movie and feel that she is not really important: even if she is there for the most important moment. Of course they also had some references to the previous movies and even make us understand what really happened with Josh; i still dont fully understand but just that he had been stuck or something? For me the story dont make sense whatsoever and they used too much times the jumpscares even if i really like the one where the father is stuck in the machine at the hospital and really feel effective fear. Im not gonna lie too the make up really was a success and create some interesting shots and horror moments(special mention to the scene where Dalton and her friend who is playing with the lights and Dalton transformed slowly; let us know that something is wrong; so to be honest some scenes work pretty well and the music by Joseph Bishara is still interesting to hear and the sound really make the tension escalate; the problem its too much jumpscares for me. Things really take time to put in place and need to be patient to really see whats really the problem with Josh and Dalton. But i spend a good time anyway even if i found the story very average and let be honest: what the story really bring? Except some non sense that we tried to justify with words. That was my thoughts on the movie. Im pretty disappointed overall mostly by the plot and the story and the first really long hour who is pretty forgettable.","

If you don't have time to rewatch them, you can find recap videos on youtube.Right from the opening shot, you can feel the quality filmmaking. I couldn't believe it's directed by Patrick Wilson (Josh in chapters 1 and 2). It's his first time in the director's chair and I think he did a great job.The movie really takes it's time, both with fleshing out the characters and with setting up the scares and creating atmosphere. Some people might find it slow since it doesn't have jump scares every few minutes. For me, I could feel the tension building until we finally get a scare. And all the jump scare attempts are successful.I loved that they chose a new setting and went in different directions than usual. It prevents the movie from feeling tired and too much like the previous ones. At the same time, it still has that Insidious essence.I had a fun time with this movie. I think most fans of the franchise will enjoy it. I also feel like it's a good example for the people who complain about too many sequels and reboots. Anything can be good if it's done right.

Sinclair Daniel does a really good job as comic relief however Rose Byrne is sadly wasted this time around with about 2 or 3 scenes at the most.As a debut, Patrick Wilson's direction is competent but nothing more.

They start off with making Josh and Dalton forget the events of Insidious 1 & 2 which makes their relationship very awkward.The reason why i say you've seen this movie before is because it's literally the first two movies without the coma & Josh being possessed. Dalton realizes he can astral project again and gets caught again. Josh goes into The Further and saves him...AGAIN. There's no explanation to The Further or the demon that constantly haunts Dalton. The only new information taken from this movie is that Josh's father could Astral Project & he died in a mental hospital. Other than that there is nothing new brought to the table. Showing the two assistants from the first movie, Elise & the red faced demon was not enough to cover up the fact that this is a horrible movie.The Jump scares are lazy. They try to force a relationship between Dalton and Chris (terribly written character btw). It's just a lot of stuff going on that has very little to do with the main plot. I never thought i'd see a Bob Ross horror film until now.

","As a big fan of the series, especially the first one, it pains me to write this review.Insidious 5 is more drama than anything, and what little fear that it boasts of is brought about mostly because of lazy jump-scares, and those scares are usually just you being jolted by a sudden explosion of noise. The movie is too slow to get off the ground, and when it does, it crashes back down.During the first half an hour or more we're sat with Josh and Dalton. Josh and Dalton have a strained relationship as Dalton is now an unlikable moody teenage brat who thinks, rightfully, that Josh has been an absent father - we're (I'm) reminded that in the last one they had both had their memories erased so as to no longer access The Further, even accidentally. They both know that something happened, but they're not sure what it was.Anyway, after the funeral of Josh's mother, Josh helps Dalton move into college, at which point we are introduced to the (supposed) comic relief of his new roommate. His roommate is one of the downfalls of this movie, trying too hard to insert her unwelcome humour (here again I feel compelled to add quotation marks), and consequently killing the whole mood; but shortly thereafter, we are introduced to another contender for biggest mood-killer - the leader of a frat-house who walks around half-naked and spouts crappola similar to that of the dolts in Bad Neighbours (a film that coincidentally also starred Rose Byrne). The whole time Dalton and his roommate were in that house that's all I could think of - Bad Neighbours.Insidious 5 is almost all bark and no bite, in that it spends a lot of time building up something that never arrives. Josh and Dalton slowly regain their ability to astral project, but we see very little of anything in the way of scary apparitions or, God forbid, the Lipstick Demon (which is a favourite of mine). Dalton sees the kid who died at the frat house, he pukes on Dalton. Josh sees his father, he smashes through the window and corners Josh in an upstairs room. Josh also has a scary encounter at the doctor's office. Dalton gets trapped in Lipstick Demon's domain, Josh rescues him and they're pursued by Lipstick Demon down a candlelit hallway - sounds a lot like the first one, no? The movie concludes with a sissy-whimper of Josh meat-shielding the red door closed and we're treated to an obviously-fake Lipstick Demon arm breaking through and then being swatted away as if it's nothing.Too much time was spent on drama and new characters that added nothing to a film that was at its core supposed to be horrifying, not funny to a bunch of nitwits who have barely scaled pubescence. Nothing was really achieved with number 5, barely any glimpses of The Further or Lipstick Demon. The only thing that scared me was my inability to stay awake until the end.","

","Insidious: The Red Door starts right were we saw the Lamberts the last time, with Josh and Dalton's memories being suppressed by Carl. Nine years later, Dalton is headed to college and the demon that once hunted him is back. Through the film the first two installments are referenced serving as a memory refresher. The first act is way too slow, dragging the film with taking too long to get to the point making act 2 and act 3 feel rushed. Even so, is a good debut for Patrick Wilson as a director. He took his knowledge and experience in the genre to bring a good finale to the Lambert's story. Both Wilson and Ty Simpkins performances brings a more emotional side of their characters creating a believable story.As expected, the film is full of jump scares but not all of them are predictable. The dark atmosphere builds up the tension creating scary moments that will make more than one jump of their seats. Compared to the rest of the franchise, Insidious: The Red Door is a good addition to it being better than Insidious: Chapter 3 (2015) and Insidious: The Last Key (2018) but not as outstanding as the first two.

The characters are just so hard to like or root for. It really was so boring and I love horror movies and like the insidious franchise. Truly an awful cash grab that really did nothing right.The ONLY plus of this movie was that the acting was pretty good. Other than that - everything was so so bad and boring. I walked out of the theater after and told my friend ""I think that was the worst horror movie I've ever seen in a horror movie. I can't elaborate how much I disliked this movie lol.","

","So, I HATED IT, but for genuine reasons and before reading my review just know that, I was actually excited for this film, I didn't had any expectations, but I was excited, I even re-watched all 4 prequels before watching this. And now I cannot believe that I am giving this movie a 1 OUT OF 10 Rating, I hardly give that rating to any movie, but INSIDIOUS: THE RED DOOR is just that DISAPPOINTING.I am genuinely Disappointed, because this film is so POINTLESS, there was no reason to make this movie at all, they did not had a story worth telling or I should say they did not have a story at all, their only pitch for this movie might be, 'The Lambert Family is back', and after that they forgot to write a compelling story.And THE LAMBERT FAMILY Characters (The selling point of this film) doesn't even feel the same. The entire story is so forced, it doesn't feel like all this is happening in an organic and a natural way, as if they had an obligation to make this movie. With that story, they shouldn't have made the film instead, even I could have written a much more compelling story than this. And there was nothing at Stakes by the end of the Movie (Climax), everything felt same-old, same-old.And since there was no story to utilise 1Hr 47Mins, the movie was so SLOW AND BORING. I felt like I didn't even watch a real movie.We thought INSIDIOUS CHAPTER-3 and THE LAST KEY were Awful, but they are masterpiece in front of this one, those 2 at least explored and developed ELISE's Story, but this one doesn't develop anything, it was so POINTLESS.It's just a Cash-grab sequel targetted to exploit the small but potent fanbase of Insidious Franchise. No wonder, Sony didn't advertised it like the Across The Spider-Verse Film recently, because they knew the S#! T they had in their hands because of BlumHouse. No Hard Feelings was even advertised better by Sony Pictures. In fact, they didn't even had anything to advertise for INSIDIOUS 5, everything has been already shown in the 2 trailers that were released, even all the Jump-Scares.I ABSOLUTELY HATED IT. Shame on The Writer(s).Also, one more thing bothers me is that with every Insidious movie they change the fundaments and dynamics of THE FURTHER. How Elise explained THE FURTHER in INSIDIOUS (2010) is completely different than how The Further works in INSIDIOUS: THE RED DOOR (2023) and INSIDIOUS: THE LAST KEY (2018). But Insidious: The Red Door (2023) is a BIGGER MESS than Insidious: The Last Key (2018).","

","While Ajmer 92 claims to be a movie which is based on true events, its also one of those few movies who actually don't manipulate things too far from real events. For any such movie which is based on true events it sometimes becomes far too diffucult to keep it 100% based on actual events, ""Ajmer 92"" is an exception as its not trying to deviate even a bit from what it claims to be. It is also a noteworthy effort that the movie makers didn't try to make this another religious controversy as the message is very clear, ""Its not about a religion or religions"", its about the victims and the shameful incident.SCREENPLAY (9/10) : The screeplay of the movie is a solid job, it keeps the audience gripped and into the movie, apart from a few scenes where i feel there was some scope of improvement when it comes to the pacing, but still i would rate it 9/10.CINEMATOGRAPHY (10/10): While being a small budget movie it wasn't expected for this movie to have such fabulous camera work. While this isn't an avengers or star wars, the cinematography gives justice to the plot in the way it should.ACTING (9/10) : All the actors in this movie have done a commendable job. Manoj Joshi has given one of his best life performances as an evilish politician. Karan Verma, Sumit Singh, Rajesh Sharma, Ishan Mishra, Alka Amit, Shalini Kapoor and all others give justice to their charactor and have given believable performances.Overall Verdict : Overall Ajmer 92 is an absoloutely amazing movie not just in terms of entertainment but also in terms of enlightenment. For those who are looking for a crime thriller, this movie does feel like a very one one indeed (except for the fact that this one really happened and is a true story).At Box Office the movie may not be able to garner crores like how Johar's and Chopras do due to poor publicity and lack of awareness, however the movie has all the potential to win critics's hearts and grab national/international award.A MUST WATCH!!!","

However, the movie falters in its second half, hampering its overall impact. Nonetheless, it still holds potential for a one-time viewing.Sai Rajesh weaves a heartrending narrative that tugs at the heartstrings while remaining relevant to contemporary audiences. The first half captivates with its relatable and entertaining content, building up to a captivating interval. Unfortunately, the second half suffers from erratic pacing, unnecessarily dragging certain scenes. Viraj Ashwin's character arc feels underdeveloped and abruptly abandoned, lacking proper closure. The climax, although emotionally powerful, may not resonate universally, contrasting with the film's initial entertainment value. Moreover, the director's handling of the second half appears disjointed and needlessly prolonged.Vijai Bulganin's exceptional background score enhances the storytelling, adding depth and enjoyment to specific sequences. The cinematography impresses, and the production values are high, although the editing could have improved, particularly in terms of pacing during the second half.Anand Deverakonda exhibits significant growth as an actor, skillfully portraying the nuanced emotions of his character. He excels in emotional scenes, evoking genuine empathy. Vaishnavi Chaitanya delivers a spectacular performance, fully immersing herself in her character and flawlessly depicting her various emotions and transformations. Her portrayal exhibits commendable depth. In a central role, she shines brightly, leaving no room for disappointment. Viraj Ashwin delivers a solid performance, although he could have delved deeper into emotional scenes. While the supporting cast performs well, Naga Babu and Viva Harsha's potential feels underutilized.","

","Elemental has several obvious glaring problems. For one thing, the attempt to make the elements' differences an overt metaphor for race/culture is shallow and misplaced at best most of the time.The story's themes and plot itself are about as worn-out and tired as the art of the story itself. Not a single new idea is really explored at this level.And, at the more surface level, the film's visuals vary greatly in quality: the environments are gorgeous, colorful, and vibrant, while the character designs appear haphazard, thrown together, and honestly kind of ugly.But where this film shines-and I mean REALLY shines, surprisingly-is in the writing of its characters.Ember and Wade are instantly distinct, understood, and likeable. They both grow tremendously and at a consistent pace. They are 110% the reason to see this film. I got emotionally wrapped up in their lives and desires in a way that I've only felt in Pixar's best films. This is the sole great achievement of Elemental.The one other thing I can praise is the sound design and the musical score-both of which are largely powerful and memorable.Maybe it's that my expectations were on the floor going into this, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy it.

252,252,/tt15789038,IonicBreezeMachine,20 June 2023," Elemental does lend itself to comparisons with Inside Out and Zootopia, but as a smaller scale film it has solid heart in spite of some rough spots.
","In a world where beings of fire, water, air, and earth exist, Ember Lumen (Leah Lewis) is a first generation fire elemental and daughter of immigrants Bernie and Cinder (Ronnie del Carmen and Shila Ommi respectively) who emigrated to Element City facing prejudice and systemic segregation to start a bodega, called The Fireplace, that is the unofficial hub of Firetown which Bernie hopes Ember will someday inherit. Ember routinely struggles to keep her temper with customers and during one such episode inadvertently damages an old water pipe which pulls in city inspector Wade Ripple (Mamoudou Athie) from the other side of town and must reluctantly issue several citations on the bodega. After learning of Ember's struggles with trying to takeover The Fireplace from her ailing father, Wade feeling guilty over it tries to help Ember save The Fireplace as well as find out why there is water still running through Firetown when it shouldn't and eventually a romance blooms in spite of the historic incompatibility with fire and water.Elemental is the latest film from Pixar and comes to us from director Peter Sohn who based the initial idea off his immigrant parents and based the underlying concept around the relationship between fire and water. The film was primarily based off of the structure of romantic comedies and dramas such as Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, and The Big Sick while also building those ideas around the core elemental one. In terms of execution Elemental does have some of the same issues of Sohn's The Good Dinosaur, but it is a nice light romance with a solid presentation of its core themes.I'll start off by saying the opening scenes where we establish Element City and the characters of Bernie and Cinder are really good as we see them rejected by several prospective renters as despite Element City's history of welcoming immigrants as per the murals on the harbor, the fire elementals being the newest entrants to society are very much treated with hostility and prejudice. This sequence continues onward with the Lumen's eventually buying a neglected building an refurbishing it as their bodega and overtime it becoming the central point of Firetown. The animation used to bring the elementals and their world to life is nicely done as there's a lot of great details in the textures and movements of the characters with the distortions of water and the movement of fire and while on occasion the world building can seem a little spotty and doesn't feel as fully realized as Zootopia's, it does a good job of addressing systemic racism in communities. Leah Lewis and Mamoudou Athie are both really solid as Ember and Wade and their interactions with each other are complemented with some cute moments and amusing exchanges. I also rather liked the relationship with Ember and her father Bernie played by Ronnie del Carmen that while sweet does a good job of setting up the wedge issue.While I think Elemental has good pieces in place, I did feel like some parts of the film felt underdeveloped especially in regards to a leak in Firetown responsible for the water seeping in that doesn't feel all that interesting and I felt like from a world building perspective it opened up some questions that the movie didn't really address. While Elemental has no villain in it, this is the kind of plot point that feels like it could've used a villain be it an unscrupulous developer or a construction firm rigging bids to add that little extra ""something"" that's missing from this plot point because it's a pretty big one and its not all that fleshed out.I liked Elemental for the things that did genuinely work even if it stands in the shadows of others who've covered similar material. I think this is a much better project from Peter Sohn in comparison to The Good Dinosaur even if like that film there are still some flubs in the presentation of the central idea even if not to the extent The Good Dinosaur had them. But contrary to what people have said, this is not one of Pixar's worst movies especially when you consider the Cars trilogy and Lightyear exist.","

","Recently we went and watched Disney's ""Elemental"", and we've got a bit to say about it!First off, we both loved this movie! The worst thing about this movie is how little we saw about it before hand. ""Elemental"" centers around Ember, a fire elemental immigrant to element city, with a bit of a temper and a ton of pressure to save and take over the family business, and Wade, a water elemental who just so happens to also be an extremely emotional city code inspector.Elemental does very well bringing to light the challenges an immigrant family/group faces in a new environment, while also making sure it's wrapped up in a cute animated rom-com. The other elements are afraid, hostile, or dismissive when it comes to the the fire district and its people,but it's evened out with the budding romance between your two main characters. It also does very well in showing how important unity is among different groups of people. The art and animation in this one are amazingly done as well! The characters, in our opinion, are all well animated, well designed, and unique enough in their own ways. The animation, as standard with Pixar, is 100% on point.Elemental, however, does lack in a select few areas. The side characters for the air and earth elements were all forgettable. Clod, Fern, Gale, and Lutz are all forgettable. The main characters and their families are well done and fleshed out. But they miss the mark on the backup characters. The story is also, nothing we've never seen before. Obviously it's hard to continuously come up with brand new never done before stories, so this is only a small critique, but it's been done before.Overall though, we loved Elemental. It's a fantastic choice to watch with the family/kids. It didn't feel like anything was forced, there's good jokes for both parents and kids, it has an emotional ending, and the movie does do a good job of getting its message across. It's a Pixar romantic comedy movie and it does what it set out to do. It won't change the world, but it's got a good message.We recommend this movie 100% if you're a fan of family friendly animation, or Disney movies in general. IMDb has this at a 7.1 but collectively we give this an 8/10.TLDR - With a few lows, we still loved elemental and feel it's a great movie to watch with the family on movie night!

","Elemental once again showcases the remarkable and dazzling visual touch, Pixar films are known for. As always, the studios meticulous attention to detail and praise worthy, imagination-driven animation stands front and center, in crafting a realistic world that audiences can get lost in. From the stellar personification of the elements, to the cleverly thought of and complementing Elemental City, the overall design is simply jaw dropping and convincing, consistent with the studios past offerings.Story-wise however, is where the film stagnates. Not to be mistaken, the immigrant centered, coming of age, breaking through barriers storyline does have its shining moments, but treads along the lines of overly familiar. The screenplay stumbles as well at times, producing blank faced reactions to some of its heavy handed scenes such as Embers family centered conflict. As for the romance, Pixar redeems itself, for fashioning an opposites attract love story, made charming by its fascinating character quirks and animation. Somehow, someway, this felt fresh.Overall, I found no surprise in critics underwhelmed responses to Elemental. It is however undeniable, that the film does enough, and if comparisons to Pixars early works can be avoided (a BIG if), deeper appreciation for Ember and Wades world is definitely in the horizon.

The last real hit was 2019's ""Toy Story 4."" Fans will appreciate the ""Carl's Date"" short, ""Elemental,"" which combines fire and water, creating a successful film, and is Pixar's and Disney's best film since zootopia. ""Elemental"" is a rom-com with nonstop puns and on-the-nose aspects, but it still has a winning sweetness. The film's chemistry between Ember and Wade is corny, but it still works well, despite the corny moments. The film's rom-com elements, such as hot air balloon rides and authentic fire food, add to its overall appeal. ""Elemental"" has the wondrous aesthetic imagination of modern Pixar classics like ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Wall-E."" However, composer Thomas Newman's score offers a more comprehensive vision of cross-cultural exchange than the film's muddled depiction of immigrant communities. While combustible from the moment, it makes a from memory after leaving the theater. Lewis portrays Ember with a playful warmth, complementing Athie's bubbling affability in Wade. The element element in ""Elemental"" is overly complicated and confusing, focusing on nothing children know about the natural world. The film's brisk pace and extensive exposition make it difficult to fit essential backstory into the final reel. Sohn should have made the plot simpler and focused on sincerity, as Pixar's sincerity is essential. The over-complicated premise creates confusing rules for children to learn, which do apply outside the film. The animation of Ember's body and Wade's fluid, transparent body is exciting, emphasizing malleability and abstraction. However, the film's promise of color, form, and movement is hemmed in by unimaginative storytelling. Only standout sequences, such as an underwater garden and hand-drawn animation, separate ""Elemental"" from other Pixar films. The characters are phosphorescent blobs traveling through realistically animated cityscapes, and the film never goes anywhere unexpected. The film follows Ember and Wade, two opposites who initially form a close bond but eventually separate due to a misunderstanding. However, their relationship becomes the film's center, a respite from the mixed metaphors and conceptual mechanics that often threaten the story's inner reality. The plot's frantic chain reaction keeps them together, providing a slight but endearing center. The film explores the mystery of what will happen if Ember and Wade touch a mysterious mystery in a city with ceramic and terracotta glass structures.","

","Elemental is bad, it's as simple as that. There were a few key issues that are easy to pinpoint, but overall the reason this failed is much more abstract. I think the main issue is that Pixar got in way over their heads. They had this story idea but no real means to animate it, so once they figured out a way to animate it (using 151,000 computer cores), they then had to work around the confines of this massive animation project. And by all means, you can tell this was an issue; cutaways and transitions are awful throughout, and you can tell that the script is majorly rushed to get past this factor; It seemed lazy. Not one character takes a breath in this film before moving on to the next rushed, poorly-written line. Scene after scene with no real meaning and every story element (pun intended) that was supposed to elicit some type of emotional response was given to you in an unsolicited flashback that made no sense. And this created some cringeworthy backstory scenes and dialogue that came out of nowhere. It was quite possibly one of the worst films I have seen in a long time, and it's more heartbreaking that it came from Pixar.Now to be fair to what they've done here, the animation is beautiful, they created a really good-looking animated film, but there was no time to appreciate it due to quick cuts and pointless filler scenes. Once again, Disney and Pixar prioritized the wrong things, taking away from this beautiful feat of animation to create a sloppy pointless story.The voice acting was also sub-par, to say the least. Most of it was average and doesn't make you think twice, except for Ember (Leah Lewis), who really shined, seeming to give real emotion in her lines despite the awful writing. But Wade (Mamoudou Athie) is a different story. His voice was heartless, in my opinion. And again, this may be the script's fault more than the voice acting since Wade was such a boring character who wasn't given a name until halfway through the film (which is insane to think about). We were given a few glimpses of Wade's emotional backstory that could have potentially had some importance to the story, but then the credits roll, and you feel the same way about him at the end as you did in the beginning. He was annoying, and his arc was flatter than the voice acting given for him.I didn't go into this film thinking it was going to be good, but I thought it could be fun. I was proven wrong in a big way. Overall the only redeeming part is its animation which is overshadowed by its story issues. It's worth a watch for the animation alone, but should not be glorified for any other aspect of it (which seems to be what many are doing.","

","To start things off, Elemental is a heartfelt movie that parallels the trials and tribulations of pursuing one's passion. While it's no easy feat to transition to a place that's completely different from your original hometown with all of its traditions and beliefs, moving into a new city that is much more diverse and expressive can become more of an opportunity if you know the right people. The one thing that remains are moral values. Director Peter Sohn sure made a movie that was greatly inspired from his parents moving all the way to America from Korea before he was even born. Although Sohn was born and raised in the states, it was his parents who showed him to also not lose sight of his heritage and family traditions.Now the plot tells the story of the Lumens, a husband and wife who traveled from the fire lands to start a new life in the multi-diverse, Element City. Which is entirely inhabited by the four basic elements that are earth, air, fire, and water. The Lumens set up shop in one district and eventually give birth to a daughter named Ember, who dreams of one day running her family's business. However, upon meeting a water-based resident named Wade, Ember's views greatly shift into something she might be truly missing in her life.Compared to past Pixar films, I think Elemental is uniquely different for the studio that combines thematic material, romantic elements, and prejudicial themes woven into one. Newcomers Leah Lewis and Mamoudou Athie as the lead roles Ember and Wade respectively did a splendid job when their characters are thrown into conflict over what really matters. I commend them for giving such believable performances and that they have this chemistry that is a science physically and emotionally. While the character designs and quirks are reminiscent to the emotions of Inside Out, it's the setting and discriminatory nature of these characters that mirror Zootopia.Peter Sohn took it a step forward with this movie compared to his directorial debut called The Good Dinosaur. Unlike that movie, where it went with the theory of dinosaurs having not gone extinct and evolved more than humans, I loved the personal touches he gave in Elemental that reflect his own upbringing and meeting someone to love in the process. Quite frankly, I don't really care what others say about this movie being ""by the numbers"" or ""not being at high standards"" as older Pixar classics or any recent animated hits of theirs. Kids will love it for the humor and whimsical nature of these elemental characters, while adults would find the intense situations relatable to them in terms of acceptance and being true to themselves.

","People are starved for originality lately, so why aren't more movie-goers flocking toward the seemingly super-imaginative Elemental, the new entry in Pixar's ""what if X had feelings"" saga? Why do people say they want originality but won't give it any attention? Hmm? What gives? Well, the issue is that the premise of Elemental might not be all that inspired. It reads as if Pixar just sort of went ""Okay, so which objects/concepts can we personify next?"" -- or ""How can we make another allegory for racism without having to teach kiddies about actual racism?"" -- and then threw the darts.You get the sense that Disney-Pixar wanted a ""next Inside Out"" or ""next Zootopia"", not that someone had a brilliant idea for a story and images that simply had to get made. There is some creativity here and I adore some voices, but the world it creates is one that raises nagging questions, both in terms of in-universe logistics (What exactly does clothing and food mean to personifications of natural elements?) and how it is supposed to be reflecting the dynamics going on in our society. If the film is anti-prejudice, why use two characters whose very nature is such that they harm each other by merely being near each other?When I reviewed Across the Spider-Verse, I spoke of how its success proves that ""people crave something with more energy, artistry, and detail than what Disney has to offer"". At that moment, I was talking about ATSV vs Marvel, but it rings true in terms of animated cinema as well (note that no Pixar or Disney release lately has compared to the reception of either ATSV or Dreamworks' Puss in Boots: The Last Wish).It also rings true in terms of Disney vs other films that tackle similar social themes. Someone on TikTok pointed out that there's just no reason to see Elemental when we already have superior, more straightforward immigrant stories in Everything Everywhere All At Once (another movie whose success is a sign of better, less Disney-heavy times) and the upcoming Past Lives.Of course, another problem for Elemental is that it got released in June, alongside too many other films to choose from (of which only a few seem to make a splash, no pun intended -- this film has enough of those). It looks very pretty, of course, but that's not enough of a draw to get people to the multiplex -- as opposed to waiting for it to land on Disney+ (where it may yet find a fandom in the ""I'm 14 and this is deep"" crowd, for whom movie tickets aren't as financially feasible as using the family Disney account).","

","Shakespeare needn't worry that Pixar's Elemental will replace Romeo and Juliet as the #1 love story of all time. However, this colorful animation has a right to be considered one of its kind in its thematic emphasis on opposites attracting and our seeking our own way rather than fulfilling someone else's dreams. Perhaps more of a dominant theme is the immigrant experience that shows the challenges of assimilation. Director Peter Sohn speaks of his Korean parents' experience as the inspiration.The linchpin of this typical Pixar piece is a world where the elements of earth, air, fire, and water peacefully co-exist if, for instance, the last two don't mix. When water denizen Wade Ripple (voice of Mamoudou Athie) falls for fire Ember (Leah Lewis), and she eventually succumbs, the incompatible worlds collide. The multiple metaphors and ingenious twists for each element, e.g., fire family business is called ""the Firehouse,"" are a tribute to the imagination of Sohn and his creative crew.The subtheme of parents' expectations is almost as strong as the love theme. Ember's dad expects her to take over his shop while she is reluctant to say she doesn't want to. Her budding romance almost busts because of this conflict. Elements does a credible job of showing how difficult it is for loving children not to fulfill the dreams of doting parents. What is not lost is the need for us to govern our own futures and not cave to the demands of others.Unlike other current movie dramas, especially animations like Spider-Man, Elements moves in a linear war with a plot that makes sense, even if it is predictable. Smaller children at my screening were restless, leading me to question if they should be 10 and beyond to appreciate the several themes; less than ten for a while will be distracted by the intricate city and explosive color.In the end it is still Pixar, a gifted Disney enterprise that never forgets it's all about the people.","

273,273,/tt0120679,Buddy-51,7 December 2002," gripping performance by Hayek
","Salma Hayek (uni-brow and all) gives a genuinely great performance as `Frida,' the Mexican artist who is more famous, perhaps, as the wife of Diego Rivera than as a painter in her own right - although Rivera himself always insisted that it was Frida who had the greater talent.Frida Kahlo was a woman who endured a life of crippling pain caused by a trolley accident in her youth, yet her innate energy, passion and love of life - as well as her enormous abilities as a painter - allowed her to overcome that daunting obstacle to achieve a measure of fame and recognition.  What she was not quite so successful in overcoming was her strenuous love/hate relationship with Rivera, which came to occupy her time and her life almost as much as her painting.  In many ways, `Frida' is a typical artist bio, highly reminiscent of other recent films in the genre such as `Pollock' and `Surviving Picasso,' both of which also dealt with the serial philandering of their male artist figures.  `Frida,' however, since it is focused more intensely on the woman's perspective, offers a few new insights into that seemingly inevitable theme.  Frida, in many ways, prides herself on her independent, fiery nature, yet when Rivera becomes a part of her life, she quickly succumbs to his seductive charms.  She marries Rivera even though she knows he is constitutionally incapable of remaining faithful to her.  Thus, she sets herself up for a life of misery with a man she is utterly incapable of living without.  That the relationship is one of utter co-dependency is demonstrated by the fact that Rivera, even after their numerous breakups, keeps coming back to his one true love.Based on the Hayden Herrera biography, the Clancy Sigal/Diane Lake/Gregory Nava/Anna Thomas screenplay doesn't paint Frida as some sort of passive victim of her own weaknesses nor as some sort of plaster saint martyr who was entirely guiltless in her own troubled life.  We see, for instance, the hypocrisy inherent in her own romantic dalliances, principally her bisexual flings with other women and even the affair she conducts with none other than Trotsky himself during the period of his exile in Mexico (right before his assassination).  We empathize with Frida because she functions as such a compelling figure in the context of the story, but we are never allowed to forget that she is a flawed human being, as capable of making a mess of her life as any of the men who generally occupy the lead position in these stories.If for no other reason, `Frida' is worth seeing for the marvelous sense of history it provides, chronicling the turbulent period of the 1920's and 1930's when socialism was the `in' cause for the art world to rally around - at least until the arrival of Stalin when the pipe dream of a worker's state and a classless society fell victim to the murderous brutality of a regime more totalitarian in nature than the one it had replaced.  Director Julie Taymor keeps the political issues of the era front and center, perfectly integrating them with the tumultuous relationship at the story's core. We witness, for instance, Rivera's struggle with Nelson Rockefeller when the latter commissions Rivera to paint a mural in one of his buildings.  When Rockefeller, the personification of capitalism, balks at Rivera's glorification of Lenin in the painting, Rivera is forced to reexamine his own commitment to the cause he so vehemently espouses (the film makes an interesting companion piece to `The Cradle Will Rock' from a few years back).   We also get to see some of the lip service paid by these artists to the socialist cause, as they live the good life among the elite pampered classes, often at the expense of the very workers whose rights they so loudly proclaim in their work.As Frida, Hayek literally carries the film.  Tender and vulnerable one moment, she can become fiery and self-confident the next.  Hayak also captures much of the excruciating physical torment that Frida was forced to endure during her lifetime - and which often became the central subject of much of her art.  Alfred Molina makes of Rivera a fascinatingly understated figure.  His seeming world-weariness camouflages a tenderness and ability to love deeply, which, apparently, few in his life - apart from Frida - were ever able to see.  Ashley Judd does a nice turn as one of Rivera's socialite devotees and Antonio Banderas makes his mark in his very brief appearance as David Siqueiros, a passionate socialist who accuses Rivera of kowtowing to the powers-that-be whom he claims to despise (Banderas is so good in the role that one regrets he isn't given more screen time).  Geoffrey Rush, unfortunately, is not given enough time or good material to make much of an impression as Trotsky.Taymor has had mixed results integrating Frida's works into the story. The director occasionally dabbles in surrealism by having Frida and Diego literally enter into the world of her paintings.  Sometimes it works; sometimes it serves merely as a fancy distraction.  Still, Taymor at least deserves credit for boldness in such scenes.All in all, `Frida' provides a fascinating portrait of its heroine - and one of the best performances of the year to go along with it.","

She falls in love with famed muralist Diego Rivera (Alfred Molina , he gained 50 lbs , 23 kg , for this character) who bears a separated marriage (to Valeria Golino) . Later on , Frida is wedded to Diego and the troubles come out .The yarn relies heavily upon their tempestuous marriage , because the different artistic temperaments burst , creating a stormy relation . The picture is correctly based on historic deeds and even Edward Norton did an uncredited rewrite of the script . Thus , it appears Leon Trosky - who has romance to Frida- , but he's murdered with a hatchet by Ramon Mercader and then is framed Diego Rivera , though later being absolved . Besides , there are several famous people : Siqueiros (Antonio Banderas) , Nelson Rockefeller (Edward Norton) , Leon Trosky (Geoffrey Rush) and others very secondaries such as Andre Breton or Josephine Baker . Frida is specially known by her mustachioed and one-brow paintings and Rivera by his impressive murals and one of them was ordered to break by Nelson Rockefeller but reflected to famous communists on the ¨Rockefeller Center¨ . The film was perfectly directed by Julie Taymor and includes magnificent cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto as when imaginatively brings to life the scenes on the Kalho's paintings , where the color is glimmer and spellbound .

","'Frida' is a rich and passionate account of two celebrated Mexican artists, whose lives were bound up with major events of the 20th century-the Mexican and Russian Revolutions... The film takes us at the center of the art world in one of the most tumultuous alliance between two painters, an alliance filled with joy and heartbreak, love and betrayal...Frida and Diego are two dynamic artists of extraordinary and diverse talents... While Diego's work is more public and monumental, Frida's paintings are grotesque and intimate on a much smaller scale...The film chronicles Frida's audacious self-introduction to the great muralist Diego Rivera, and her physical ailments... There is pain in this woman's life, a pain she don't deserve to have, a pain no one deserves to have... There's a line in the film where Kahlo says, 'at the end of the day, we can all endure much more than we think we can.' and I think this one line resumes everything about her...Salma Hayek proves herself that she's more than just another pretty face... Salma is full of vigor as the angry strong-willed female artist caught in a net of pain... It's pleasing to see Hayek in a production where she is totally confidant, sexy and lusty in an uncomplicated way... Salma captures the spirit of Frida and plays it with heart and style, longing for the healing touch... She dances a provocative tango with Ashley Judd, and goes to Paris to explore her bisexual side...The chemistry between Salma and Molina is terrific... Her passion for art is overtaken by her passion for him... She expresses her emotions by teasing him, by playing practical jokes, by exciting the jealousy of his wonderful wife, Lupe Marin (Valeria Golino).But Frida remains in Rivera's shadow... She calls herself ""a charming amateur."" She focuses on her expressive self portraits of her physical pain, anger, and disappointment... Yet while viewers are left with the impression that there is undoubtedly more to Frida's life than what appears on screen, what we get instead is a love story, a tale of Frida's romantic, and tempestuous union to the unfaithful husband she marries twice and never stopped to love...London-born actor Alfred Molina is absolutely splendid as the lovable Rivera... He is a well-known womanizer who can never be faithful to any woman... Diego is a painter of conviction... A revolutionary painter who believes in Frida's anguished brush, and championed her work... He decides to create paintings which would speak directly to the common people...In a motion picture that sweeps from the late 1920s into the 1950s, Julie Taymor proves to be a director of taste and sensitivity... She captures the mood of the moment with genuine flair and style... Her imagery is exciting, and we are convinced that we are seeing Mexico in the first half of the 1900s, with its native markets, textiles, music, and food... Julie Taymor infuses it with elements of Frida's artistic creativity, bringing much of her work to life... Her film was nominated for six Academy Awards...Vague references to the political struggle between Trotsky and Stalin make their way into the script... The film ignores Siqueiros' central role in the unsuccessful attempt on Trotsky's life in 1940... But the motion picture details the mistake of Nelson Rockefeller commissioning Rivera a huge fresco for his public hall...","

","It wouldn't matter what you might show or say - people who have taken a liking to an 'artist' or their particular 'style' will defend them regardless. So it probably is with Frida Kahlo and Diago Rivera. Every country must have its acclaimed legends good or bad - the USA with Pollock and Warhol, Spain with Picasso and so it goes - it's the law of economics and superiority, etc...Oh, not to mention art....This glossy film version of Kahlo's life and work sets out to make a hero of her and nothing will stand in its way. In the attempt to do so it pulls out all stops ~ striking visual imagery from Mexican born director of photography Rodrigo Prieto (Water For Elephants '11) ~ marvelous visual effects from Dawson and Schrecker ~ good performances from most of the cast ~ OK (if overly voyeuristic) direction from Julie Taymor ~ evocative music score by Eliot Goldenthal ~ lots of color and angst.Maybe there wasn't a great deal to work with in Kahlo's life, as the movie spends more time indulging in over detailed examinations of her somewhat sordid private life. This may not seem so sordid if you happen to be into numerous extramarital affairs --with either sex that just happens to suit the situation-- According to the screenplay Frida divorced Rivera on grounds of his extramarital affairs - even though she knew of these right from their first meeting and he had told her many times he was incapable of any control over them. Problem was, Frida's own marital agreement was often broken in the same way but unlike Frida, Rivera (it seems) was not willing to dabble with both sexes. It's also obvious Frida had been known for her unabashed carnal indulgences as a schoolgirl - let alone an adult - in or out of marriage. Of course fans will excuse these dalliances on the grounds of her 'artistic' temperament and physical sufferings - well, so be it. Many will regard this movie highly (especially the fans) others may feel a little left out. Good looking but maybe not a great deal more...","

","Usually, when you see a biopic about a famous artist and genius you either get to see a tragic, suffering creature or an idealized God. And often it's always the same: He/she was born, had a difficult childhood, created some masterpieces, had some affairs (usually with actors/actresses or/and musicians) and dies a sad and lonely death. But what a refreshing difference ""Frida"" was! Frida Kahlo's life was more suffering than joy, yet the movie does not pity her all the time but shows Frida's lust for life, love, art and her husband Diegor Riviera.It tells the story of a really unusual life: When Frida is a student, young, beautiful, full of live and in love with a gorgeous boy (Diego Luna from ""Y tu mama tambien"" and ""Dirty Dancing  Havanna Nights) she experiences a horrible accident when her bus crashes with a tram. Frida then becomes a cripple for the rest of her life, but through this she experiences herself in a new way and starts to paint, mostly self-portraits where she deals with her pain, her family, political situations and people she loves. Soon after the accident a miracle happens: Frida learns to walk again and the first thing she does is to visit the famous artist and painter Diego Rivera to ask his opinion about her paintings  the beginning of an unusual and often complicated love story that should last a lifetime.We get to learn a woman who experiences so many tragic things in life that it should be enough to commit suicide, yet she never gives up, grows stronger and one thing that certainly helps her through hard times is her wit, her dignity and her love for life and art. She takes what she wants and needs (which also includes love affairs with men and women) but has also a lot to give. Plus her works, so honest, brutal but also beautiful in their truth, reveal one of the greatest talents of our time.A whole lot of this movie works of course through its female protagonist, whose role is not that easy and a real challenge sometimes. The wonderful and graceful Salma Hayek, who is immensely gifted, does really great work here and awakes Frida and her world to life again. Hayek perfectly holds the balance between triumphs and losses, joy and sorrow, madness and daily routine, life and death. She is just a pleasure to watch, she doesn't play Frida, she IS Frida. Another important character is of course Diego Rivera, the greatest love of Frida's life. Alfred Molina, a great British actor, is perfectly casted for this role and besides, has a remarkable resemblance to the real Diego. Outstanding performances also by the supporting cast: Valeria Golino, Ashley Judd (with a great imitation of the Mexican accent), Geoffrey Rush and Edward Norton.Frida  a feast for the senses full of life and exploding emotions and a tribute to a truly unique and remarkable woman, who was the greatest female artist of the last century!","

Selma Hyack does a great job portraying the Mexican artist Frida Kahlo, who marries, puts up with, and in some ways, maybe even excells famed Mexican muralist Diego Rivera.  It's a tough role and Hyack seems to let it all hang out in many ways.Alfred Molina is good, but not great as Rivera, and the rest of the supporting cast also performs well, including a cameo appearance by Ashley Judd as Italian born-photographer and leftwing activist Tina Modotti.The direction is crisp and effective throughout, and the colors and ambiance of the film are simply great.  This is a movie about artists and it fullfills the first requirement of art.  It is visually stunning to look at.What intrigues me is the heated debate this generates among those who know and admire Frida.  It may well be impossible for anyone to make a bio picture that satisfies purists, those who are quite familiar with the subject matter.  But purists have to realize that movies are too expensive and difficult to make (this one took decades)for the moviemakers to concentrate on such a small audience.  They have to look at the big picture and make a film that is understandable to mass audiences, or else count on losing millions of dollars.For myself, I knew next to nothing about Frida Kahlo, only that I had seen some of her paintings and that she was Rivera's wife.  Since I like Rivera's work, I went to see the film. But I knew more about Tina Modotti when I walked into the theater than I did about Frida.Whether this was an accurate portrayal of her character and life, I haven't a clue. But I do feel I came away knowing a lot more about her than I used to.My single gripe is that the film seemed to make Frida take a back seat to her husband when it came to art. She is portrayed as someone who is very unsure about the value of her own work.  But I can't get too mad about that, because Frida may have been that way in real life for all I know.
I am a leftist politically, but I think we often get much too caught up in politics and rhetoric and often assign political meanings to things when they don't apply.  It is very, very complicated to make a biography and no 2 hour film is going to capture every facet of a complex person's personality, mucy less cover every aspect of their lives.Overall,I'd say ""Frida"" accomplished its limited mission. It told me something about an artist I knew little about. I will now look for more of her work.  I provided me with some fine acting, direction, etc. And perhaps best of all, allowed me to spend two hours in Mexican culture in some way, shape or form.  I enjoyed the experience.","

Yes, Salma Hayek inhabits the character of Frida and makes it entirely her own. But Alfred Molina's portrayal of her overweight, philandering husband really brings this movie to life. History is important to this movie also. Although removed from the turbulent events dominating European politics in the 1930s, Mexico embraces the ideology that will soon tear Europe apart and reflects that ideology in its art. Diego Rivera, as portrayed by Molina, is certainly a greater lover of women and painting than he is of political ideology, but the fact that he plays host to the exiled Trotsky shows that he is willing to put himself in harms way for the sake of his political principles. Trotsky is played charmingly by Geoffery Rush and his introduction to the story sends Diego and Frida's marriage to another level. This movie never fails to surprise you and if you have not seen it yet, you should.","

Unfortunately, the underlying story of the love affair between the title character, Frida Kahlo, and her husband, Diego Rivera, tells an unpleasant tale of irresponsibility and betrayal.  Nevertheless, Kahlo's art is cleverly used to tell her story and Hayek's and Molina's terrific performances manage to invest Kahlo and Rivera with an attractiveness I suspect they lacked in real life.

Although Kahlo may be more attributable to her surreal paintings and dramatic marriage to more popular painter Diego Rivera, the movie focuses on the sex lives and deeply held socialist beliefs of the couple. In the film Rivera loses a sale to John Rockefeller (Edward Norton) with a depiction of Lenin in a mural.  The couple even gave refuge to Leon Trotsky (Geoffrey Rush) after having been exiled from Russia/Europe.

","First off, you should know that this is the first part of one big movie split into two, Harry Potter style. Except, everyone in the theater went nuts when it ended, I guess because it doesn't have ""Part One"" in the title. It doesn't really stand on its own, as far as the story goes. So it's kind of hard to rate it, since it set up way more than it concluded. Can't wait to see the next one.Anyway, even as just one half of a two-parter, this movie is awesome. If you thought you liked the style of ""Into the Spider-Verse"", then you got another thing coming. This movie is so much more than that, it's crazy, and it does not disappoint. Boggles the mind how this much stuff can even be animated at all.The visuals have got to be seen to be believed. Every scene has so much going on, and you could even say each scene has its own art style. It goes way beyond what the first movie did, and that was already crazy. The blending of styles on its own makes this a one of a kind movie, that will be hard to replicate. I'm even sort of mad that this creative energy hadn't been released before, because we are getting some insane stuff nowadays.One small complaint I do have is that all this, combined with the very fast action can make it a bit hard to breathe sometimes. Honestly I can't take too many points off for that though.The soudtrack is great, I can't wait for it to release. There truly are some bangers in there, and most of them are actually the score of the movie, not licensed music.And the story is awesome as well, although again it's hard to judge before seeing the next one. There's a lot more going on than in the first one, and most This movie explores the character of Gwen more and it's awesome. It's still about Miles though, and that part is also cool. I loved the Spot.So yeah I could say more, but I think you should just go see it. This might end up as one of the best trilogies of all time.","

","LIKES:The Pace For The Most Part
-Comic book movies are an art that requires balance to tell all it has to tell, and Miles' next story.. has A LOT to tell.-It found a good pace for me to tell the story, giving you the character development, but not at a pace that was too slow and lost on itself, for the most part.-Yet, the movie did manage to keep it slow enough that there was real development, build up, hints, and appreciation to age like fine wine.-This dynamic was very impressive to me, keeping an engaging movie for my attention, but not skimping out on the action like some of these deeper movies try to do.-That takes talent in the cooking pot as big as this, building on the past movie, but yet doing its own thing until the end for the setup.The Voice Acting
-Everyone rocks in this movie, and I have to agree with my friend that it is grade A on many levels with what you get in live action movies.-Isaac is still strong as the anti-hero role that he often plays. His moodiness, his anger, his dark edge are mirrored in the character. There is hurt, anguish, and the fire that he shows so well, and I love how his voice is the main focus in his performance and not the looks.-Hailee Steinfeld is fantastic in Gwen. It's like taking all of her characters from her movie and integrating a piece of them into this Gwen and expanding her far into a character I really liked.-She was vulnerable and strong, a realistic character whose performance came out in spades and fully awakened the character I think they were going for.-And Moore... well Moore is just freaking amazing as Morales. That tone, vulnerability, this maturity but still immaturity cascading and once more evolving a character from the first one being believable. A stellar performance and one that I think brought so many things together, engaging with each of the others into this dynamic role.-It all works so well and I loved the strong talent bringing things to life.The Storytelling
-There are so many who say that comic movies seldom tell a good story or are telling the same story over and over again. And to a degree... they are right.-Yet... for Across the Spider-Verse, that story feels fresh, engaging, and grounded to a degree that helps balance reality and super heroism into a great mashup.-It's not so in your face super adventures that are all about action, violence, and CGI madness, but it also isn't CW bologna about exploring our feelings in colorful underwear.-This sequel really focuses so much on building up characters, but integrating it into this main comic adventure that works to keep both involved and feel like a superhero.-I love the heart into it, and the way they built up from the first movie, but yet made this movie its own thing, until the final moments where the known cliffhanger was going to come in.-And to add relative components to it, engaging characters, and keeping those characters involved in the story... that is tough work.The Comedy To A degree
-I really enjoyed the diverse comedy in this movie, and how many types of jokes and styles that were in it.-Miles is sort of a jack of all trades, sarcasm, banter, slapstick, he has a little bit of everything in it and I love it.-Others are just rambling idiots who are throwing so many jokes and statements that some eventually hit, but you have to listen because they fluctuate in terms of volume and such.-And other jokes are so well-timed and loaded with sarcasm that you just appreciate the laugh from the time alone.-It has it all and in relative balance to keep things fresh and not overwhelmingly stale as they hope from one joke to the other.The Nostalgia and Easter Eggs
-Part of that comedy comes in the references loaded into this movie almost as much as the plot in this movie, and it works.-Across the Spider-Verse, tackles many famous tropes in both Spiderman comics and movies, blending the two of them together into this natural flowing arc that utilizes it well.-Nostalgia reigns supreme in this movie, all the comic and show references of the webbed wonder just taking my child nature and taking it for the roller coaster ride of finding everything I could.-But the movie references as well... so much fun as well, seeing these micro moments and nods to the other universes and watching them blended into the comedy and story.-Then to have it just in the world, it's going to make for a fun rewatch potential in the future.The Action Scenes
-A huge step up, Across the Spider-Verse took my dislike from the first film and unleashed much more of the action I knew it had.-The opening scene paints for some great things to come, but soon the fight scenes and adventure transform into something that is fun, exciting, and family friendly.-Chase scenes have energy, with styles that flow and show off the heart of the animation, feels of the comic book and fan art coming together into this cascade of color and energy.-I loved the way that they evolved past punches and added more emotions and stakes that though predictable still held glimmer of exciting twists if they come.-And the fact they can punch, kick, and slam without being bloody messes should please so many, alongside the fact that the action all goes in line with the actual plot.The Animation/Art Style
-You've seen the trailers and the first one and know how beautiful the movie is. Amidst the blurry backgrounds, the movie really has bold art direction that captures comic book spirit.-The computer animation goes well with the natural feel of the art, and I loved the way it felt like flipping through a flip book and seeing it come to life.-It respects both worlds so well, and like the story keeps things easy to follow and discover to appreciate everything the Spider-Verse had to offer. That was epic.-And to keep all that in relatively stable camera work, something the first movie struggled with, shows how you can really continue to improve if you take the time and think things through.DISLIKES:The Comedy A Bit Too Forced
-There are times where the humor is a bit forced for me, primarily in the moments where they just spout joke after joke after joke to the point where things get lost.-These moments are few and far between for me, but there are times where a character gets annoying over funny.Some Pacing Offsets
-There are times where the movie trips up on the pace for me. A few moments where the conversations are dragged out or we get a tad touchy feeling and not enough of seeing what's going on.-This happened about the first hour or so for me, but once that part passes most of the movie establishes the pace I talked about for much of the movie.-At least until the need.The Ending 20 minutes for me
-The ending 20 minutes felt very dragged out as it set up the cliffhanger we knew was coming the moment it said part 1 long ago.-The ending is very drawn out, you know the movie is over, and you know what is coming, but it uses the art to drag it out, bloating the movie for the twenty minutes that could have been in the next movie.-Fortunately one of the final moments adds that fantastic bridge with music, shots, and feels that work, but still... we could have cut a few things out.-And fortunately there are no end credits, which there does not need to be.The Sound Quality With Some Characters
-It might have been my theater, but some of the characters mumble and talk fast meaning... it's hard to hear them.-Spider-Punk has some of the best lines, but they get drowned out by background noise, mumbling speakers, and sound inconsistencies.-This leads to missing several things and taking away from the character that seems so cool, and this happens to several other characters when there is so much noise. As such, those moments are annoying to me, but again could be theater dependents.The VERDICT:
Overall, the praise is worthy to Across the Spider-Verse, and I was very happy with much of the film that they brought to life to this theater. It's a sequel that does things right, taking the first movie's foundations and bringing with it something to build up and enjoy to the full extent. That bold and beautiful art has been refined to near perfection, and does so much storytelling alone that it's almost enough to go see it just for that in theater. But the movie integrates story, morals, comedy, nostalgia, and action to a degree that really feels like some of the strongest storytelling in a superhero movie. I love the authentic feel of a superhero story, and I love the passion of balancing so much in a movie without every losing track of the story to tell. Sure there were pacing issues and some sound flops for me, but that's really minor when it comes to the movie overall and everything they did to make this movie the middle of the trilogy, but still stand on its own. You can obviously guess I'm recommending this for the theater, and yes families can see it as there aren't too much dark moments. And my scores for those who need it are:Animation/Action/Adventure: 9.0-9.5
Movie Overall: 8.5.","

","I absolutely loved 2018's ""Into the Spider-Verse"". It not only earned its ""Best Animated Picture"" Oscar, not only was it the best Spider-Man movie, but it stands as a landmark in animation. It set the record for most animators working on a single film. That record was then broken by this sequel. With five years of anticipation, and with the talented hands of Lord and Miller behind the scenes I was super hyped for this movie. I was prepped to love this film. I had heard nothing but good things, and all its praise is well deserved. But I couldn't help but walk away just saying the film was...good.Given the film's stellar reception, I feel compelled to explain why I only am giving this film a respectable 7. First off, this film is not a complete story. It is a ""part 1"" and ends on a ""To Be Continued..."". I don't think that's a spoiler considering the original teaser advertised it as ""Across the Spider-Verse: Part 1"". But like the great cliff hangers of the past, like ""Two Towers"", ""Empire Strikes Back"" or ""Back to the Future part 2"", the movie needs to complete some self-contained conflict. This film does not complete a conflict. There is no feeling of resolution. I feel my full review is currently being held hostage from the fact that the story is incomplete. I can't give this full marks considering the story could end like the series ""Lost"" and completely undermined the whole journey.With that out of the way, I can tell you all the things that makes this movie great. The animation is a step up even from the previous groundbreaking entry. There are so many different animation styles that the team juggles, and it they all looked visually stunning. For some it may be over stimulation, but I thought it moved at just the right speed.The ""fan service"", ""Easter Eggs"" or whatever you want to call them, are never overused. There are some movies that treat the Easter Eggs like they are the main course, this movie balances them well. They never overstay their welcome and always add to the story as opposed to distract from it.The humor is spot on. There are so many jokes in this movie that had me laughing awkwardly loud. The jokes don't have the typical MCU problem of detracting from a serious moment, those are given the time to breath. But the jokes are fast paced, witty and come from a variety of sources. There are visual gags, character jokes, situational jokes and it isn't all reliant on a single person for their humor.And the action in this movie, it is next level stuff. Every fight scene or chase scene is like the bridge fight in ""Kung Fu Panda"". The movement is fluid, the detail is superb, and everything falls in just the right place. It is poetry in motion, since they are Spider-Men doing the action, all the acrobatics and reflexes work well within the story. It is a reminder of what makes this character so much fun to write for.There are 2 main conflicts that pop up in the story, both feeding into the same narrative theme. When the second comes into focus, that is where the movie loses some momentum. It is nice for story reasons in that our hero feels completely alone. The problem is it raises a lot of questions that might get answered in later movies, but for now are ignored. On the positive side, just when I think I have the film figured out, it throws one last hook at me, and absolutely has me hooked for the next one.Who knows, maybe one day when the trilogy is completed, I will come back and amend my review. But as it stands right now, I can't give it anything higher than what I gave it. Don't let me down third movie, with great power, comes great responsibility.","

The fact that this is a cliffhanger and it ends very abruptly makes it feel like it's both overly long and incomplete. There is so much going on in this film and so many new characters introduced and just as the plot finally starts to pick up and get good they end it on the cliffhanger. I don't understand how people are giving this movie such a high score but complaining so much about Fast X doing the same thing. This film is not complete and for that reason I felt like it wasn't as enjoyable as it could've been.","

","I was really blown away by this masterpiece. It's beautiful, clever, funny and deep. And it dares being a comics in each and every frame. It never allows you to forget these are drawn characters you see. Unlike so many animated movies of recent time it doesn't go for the smooth polished look it makes certain we never forget that we watch a comics book that was brought to life on screen. Just like Rembrandt made sure we all see his brush strokes when we watch his paintings. But just like Rembrandt, it's done without allowing the technical mastery of it all to drop one little bit. But it's way more than simple issue of the looks of it. This is comics all the way, thematically as well as visually, hence the ending we got.They didn't give up on anything; didn't allow a single detail to go amiss. They wouldn't give up on any bit of storytelling. It's all there, no matter how long the final cut will be, and still, it's not too long not even a second too long. The characters are all fully developed - real human beings drawn in comics form, but human just like any of us watching them on screen. It calls for some of the best voice acing I've seen, by each and every member of the cast. I simply can't single out anyone of them. They were all superb.And than the story itself - It's way more than just sci-fi comics. It doesn't limit itself to the usual issues of power and its moral implications. It's asking us the deep questions of what determines the path our life take? Are we ruled by our destiny? Is it all written in our stars? If I had a problem with most of the comics I read it was because of the fatalistic approach adopted by most of them. This one defies the tradition in the best way. It breaks down all the accepted rules and leaves us all hanging in one of the best cliff hangers ever.If you love comics, science fiction, action movies or simply real brilliant cinema - go see it.","

Almost all the side characters feel real and fleshed out - even those with minimal screen time.The bad: It's most definitely a middle chapter and the film suffers for it. The movie is long, the pacing suffers, and scenes feel drawn out - which makes sense when you understand it's not trying to reach the end. The movie 'finishes' literally in the middle of a plot beat - when it didn't need to. Empire Strikes Back has shown us how it's done. It feels like pure marketing/money making tactics.

The animation is good but sometimes less is more, and there was less differentiation between the styles, I don't think bill sienkiewicz was involved in this one. I remember my emotions building in the first one, peaking when what's up danger kicked in in the soundtrack, but this got into some schlocky emotional teen drama territory that made me yawn. I also felt it was a bit cynical to split it in two, I'm sure the full story could have been told in one movie which would have upped the quality of the animation too. Then there was the sense of universal danger overload that this and other stories revert to to ramp up the drama; whether a universe or every parallel universe and it's uncle is at stake, who cares, trying to make it bigger than before doesn't increase drama, that comes from character and plot development, yeah, like it did in the first one.

By the time the film picked up its pace and stakes (the last 30 minutes) I was already mentally checking out, watching the time and waiting for it to end. And yes, basically nothing is resolved by the end of it, if you're wondering. Multiple people in my theater were groaning as the credits began rolling, due to the cliffhanger. Scenes stretched on far too long, had repetitive dialogue and just set up the final movie. I truly don't see the hype about this one.

","SCORE: 10/10I am still processing this storytelling masterpiece. Before I get into the review, huge shoutout to my cousin for being an Associate Editor on this project. It was so amazing seeing his name, R. Chett Hoffman, in the credits. Such a proud and inspirational moment. He will go down in cinema history for helping create one of, if not the greatest animated movie of all time.When I say greatest animated movie of all time, I'm not saying that from a story perspective. I'm saying it while taking into account both the story and the animation style. The story was still fantastic and crafted well, but something like Toy Story is just going to be hard to beat for me, which is just personal preference at the end of the day. For a comic book movie, you can't get any better animation style put to screen. It's innovative, way ahead of its time, and unlike anything I've ever seen. Once Miles shows up to the place that the rest of the Spider-People are, the story takes a completely different form. It goes from setup to every Spider-Man fan's dream. It truly had something in there for everyone. Not only were the cameos and use of the Spider-World very well thought out and effective, but the plot of the movie finally comes together and reveals the meaning behind everything that has been going on.When I saw the canon thing show up on Gwen's watch, I was confused at first. It's probably the dyslexic in me, but I was thinking cannon like the weapon. Once Miguel started explaining Miles' place in all of this and how each Spider-Man story has followed a canon story, it all made sense to me. You hear the word canon thrown around a lot in a franchise to ask if certain projects are ""canon"" to the bigger story being told. Using Uncle Ben's death as the main focus point of the canon was genius, which allowed them to include the coolest cameos of the entire film in Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire. There were so many more, but those 2 stuck out to me, just like the other ones did for people who had connections with the other Spider-People. One connection we all shared was with the group formed in Into The Spider-Verse, which all came back in a big way. All of these amazing cameos and references made the story fun and exciting, but it wasn't what made it the most meaningful.The most meaningful part of the story was discovering that Miles wasn't supposed to be bit in the first place, and that he was the first ever anomaly. From that moment on, everything starts to come together and make sense, with twists and turns in the story happening one after another. That is, until we are brought to the biggest twist of them all. Miles travels back to the Earth that originally contained the spider that bit him, Earth-42. With the absence of Spider-Man, was Miles just a normal kid? What things unfolded by having the canon broken in this Universe? We find out that the Prowler still lives, but the identity of the Prowler is unknown. That leaves us to the ultimate cliffhanger for Part 1, where it is revealed that Miles had become the Prowler in that Universe. Seeing the duality of Miles as Spider-Man and the Prowler was the PERFECT way to leave us wanting more and to cap off this amazing film. I know that will be up for debate until we see Beyond the Spider-Verse, which comes out at the end of March 2024, but I thought it was an awesome twist.To be fair, the first part of the movie started off really slow. The length of time Miles was at odds with his parents and concealing his identity lasted too long. It was important to set the scene, but I feel like the beginning dragged on for longer than it needed to. That's literally the only bad thing I can say about it. Everything else was perfect and I think it is better than the original, only by a little. It was beautiful, it was breath taking, and it was mastery on full display.","

","Adjusted rating - 8.5/10: a genuine spectacle, you could take thousands of shots from this movie and turn them into posters, it's beautiful to look at. I'd definitely suggest seeing this at the cinema because the use of colours and the work which has gone into the animations is undoubtedly the highlight, I actually can't think of a more visually creative movie I've seen. Great soundtrack too, and quite funny. One of my criticisms is it's got that ""Deadpool"" kind of style where literally everything is tongue in cheek, it needed more genuinely serious scenes just to break it up. Like there are these big arguments and then a joke is thrown in half way through, who does that? Also it's got quite bad dialogue but it's a family superhero movie so I went in expecting that, only a minor point really.Real rating - 7/10: it's half a movie man!! It's a part 1, and I feel a bit cheated that I went in not knowing that. There was commotion in the cinema when it ended, a lot of people were annoyed. I just don't get this trend in cinema, for me a great movie needs to be able to stand on its own. 2h30 is plenty of time to tell a compelling story without ending on a cliffhanger. Think the plot would've been better suited to a series format - it's already kind of like a high budget Arcane in feel - but obviously that wouldn't work with the first movie and it wouldn't make as much money. To make it a great movie they should've dissolved one of the sub plots and actually finished it.","

","Granted, this film is not going to appeal to people who have never been fans of any games featuring the titular brothers. But given the fact that these filmmakers were tasked with making a movie that caters to a fan base that spans four decades and thus have a myriad of tastes and expectations, they did a pretty good job. In fact, a slightly better job than I was expecting.The voice cast was the subject of much controversy, and I thought that for the most part it was actually spot-on. A couple of characters were horribly miscast in my opinion, but in particular Jack Black as Bowser and Charlie Day as Luigi shine as perfectly encapsulating the spirit of the characters.Platforming elements from the games was very efficiently worked into the action sequences, and some of them were quite thrilling. This is easily Illumination's most visually stunning film, and a massive step up from every one of their other films since the first Despicable Me.As for the plot, it's just the plot of every Mario game. And for the most part, that's all it needs to be. Every beat plays out almost exactly like you'd expect it to, with a couple subversions pleasantly thrown in there.The messiest parts of the movie, if I'm going to get critical, are the dialogue (which is often quite stupid) and the characters. They just try to deal with too many of them, and although four or five characters are strongly introduced with background and desires, almost none of these introductions actually amount to a payoff, and even when there is a payoff, it's haphazardly thrown together for a rushed ending.Although I think 85-90 minutes is actually the perfect length for an animated film normally, this one could've benefitted from an extra 10-20 minutes to flesh out these points a bit more. We move so quickly from location to location that there's never any time to breathe or get invested.But that's my adult perspective. I had a pretty breezy, fun, and heartwarming time, though I would've liked more meat on the script.My theater was PACKED, and probably 75% young children, and they all seemed to have the time of their lives.

","5 out of 5 stars.The Super Mario Bros movie is an awesome animated adventure film that is one of the best adaptation of a video game series. It has everything you can ask for. Its like an open world of nintendo game series like Donkey Kong making an appearance.The film is fast paced. The plot is good. It has a story about the bros. The film features a lot of easter eggs that can hint for more movies. The action sequences are awesome. Bowser is an awesome villain. The animation is beautifully done and stunning. The voice talent is also great.One of the best sequences involving a mario kart chase on a rainbow road is insane. Fans and kids will love the series and love how everything is put together in this film. Overall, i love everything about the film. I can not wait for more.","

",This movie is so much damn fun and I absolutely loved everything about it. The composing in this movie is some of the best I've ever heard and it fit so well in the movie. The voice acting was pretty good too and I didn't think Chris Pratt would be any good as Mario but he was actually pretty good but Jack Black stole the show as Bowser as he absolutely killed his role. Charlie Day was great too as Luigi as he was probably my 2nd favorite in the movie. The only problem I have with this movie is it felt so quick and I wish it was longer and it's only 90 minutes. Other than that this movie is just a ton of fun and worth the watch.,"

","**Possible Spoilers**30 years since 1993's fever dream live-action nightmare, The Super Mario Bros. Movie rights the wrongs of the last one; though it's certainly not a perfect movie, it's perfectly fine for what it is, and as family entertainment goes I've seen far worse than it. And with the gorgeous animation, the faithfulness to the games and the music, Chris Pratt and co. Do their best with the same old 'Mario comes to save Peach' storyline being worn thin at this point.Sure the film's problems can be dissected to the nth degree on YouTube retrospectives talking about the movie, but it is what it is and it works where other blockbuster fan-service vehicles have failed (like Terminator: Dark Fate, Ghostbusters 2016 or The Lion King 2019). And Mario (at least Nintendo) has the potential to become a cinematic powerhouse that defies the 'bad' press and reviews (they're more mixed for the movie).The film is basically feature-length comfort food more than anything else; and considering it's a family film that's pretty harmless, I'd say it's done its job more than well. Certainly better than Illumination's other more recent films I'd say.The Super Mario Bros. Movie is the safest kind of cinema, and maybe some people should accept what they see; but not everyone has to. Besides, fun is fun. 3.5/5 stars.P. S. Could this film lead to other stuff like Zelda hitting the big screen? Or maybe even Metroid? Who knows?","

","I went to see the highly anticipated Super Mario Bros movie tonight with my mum, whom was my gaming buddy back in my childhood days. We'd spend hours playing Mario All-Stars on my dad's SNES, and later on we played on our Mario edition Wii.As a gamer, this movie was a promiseland I wish I could stay in forever. Admittedly, I was sceptical about Chris Pratt voicing everyone's favourite Italian plumber, but he did a superb job and he deserves a lot of praise for his dedication to the role. From learning about power-ups, to fighting against Donkey Kong, and to racing along the infamous Rainbow Road with all the drifts we've all performed countless times on MK8 and its predecessors, this movie is a huge dose of nostalgia for millennials, and a nice introduction for the younger generations.My hat goes off to Mr Jack Black for his awesome job bringing the big, bad Bowser to life on the silver screen. He was the primary reason I wanted to go and see this movie so badly, and he did exceedingly well.","

","I love Mario, and I enjoyed this movie, and so did my 7y/o. But with that out of the way I'll be honest - this movie is quite bad, as movies go. The story is barely present, every scene leads into the next with very little plot or agency - things just happen, characters just need things, that place is suddenly a karting city, that other place has an elevator leading up to a castle straight up a cliffface. The script is probably just screams and the a few catchphrases. It's all held together by nostalgia baiting, references and pandering, wrapped in Minions slapstick. It is all barely coherent. There is also a thing to be said about the music which was murdering classic tunes, some of which is just shockingly bad.Is it a Mario movie? Sure. Is it a fun Mario product for the whole family? Yup. Is it a good movie? No, not really, in fact I'd give it a 6 if I am honest; not awful, but that's about it. So if you are 8 or a Mario fan - sure, you are likely to have a blast. But if you're just a person looking for a fun animation movie wholy uninvested in Mario? Nah, you can probably pass on this.","

","The story was simple, but worked wonders with the excellent characters that perfectly reflected their game counterparts. They even had unique aspects given to them that helped them stand out in all the right ways. The action was phenomenal with great depth and detail that shows how much work was put into this. There were so many nods and references to other classic Nintendo properties that you'd want to go back to find them all. And Charles Martinet is in this with a small but great role. But with all that said, it does mess up its flow with some of the music. Definitely not the original score though, since it mixes the classic music with an epic and emotional tone. But the copyrighted music Illumination probably payed a third of their budget for felt out of place in this film and took me out of the experience a couple times. Other than that, it's an amazing that I'll gladly watch again.","

","As a Super Mario fan myself, I was hyping this movie up for quite a while. So was it worth that hype? Yes and no. The references, animation, voice acting, and world building are incredible. But, there's a lot of filler and the plot isn't that good either. Despite that, I still really enjoyed it. Though admittedly kinda unnecessary, I really enjoyed watching the Mario Kart section. Same with the Luigi stuff, especially the ""you just got Luigi'd"" line. Though there are some other problems like Toad not really being funny, and this movie is kinda boring sometimes, but it's mostly pretty entertaining. So overall, solid 7/10 movie, must watch for Mario fans but it may not be for everyone else. If you want a Mario film that's an actual masterpiece, go watch Cute Mario Bros The Third Movie. It's not really based on the series, but besides that it's incredible.","

","The headline basically tells the story. This is not a good movie. Anyone who claim this is a great fantastic movie probably have some issues. But this is neither as horrible as I see some people argue. This is just a middle-of-the-road sometimes funny decently entertaining movie with bad music and very lazy writing.The good is that this is decently fun, even funny a few times. And if you are a fan of the games, especially Mario Cart, you will smile through many scenes. The voice acting is great, and if you are a simple kid you are likely going to love this. Sadly there ends the good stuff.The bad starts with the story, or rather lack thereof. Because it is as simplistic as the games which is both a strength and a weakness, but mostly a weakness because this movie offers nothing. It is actually kinda soulless and cliche. The music is mostly atrocious. Just put on Mario Cart music on bad speakers and you basically have this movie. But what really bothers me though is that the lack of story and very simplistic writing which feels so lazy. No one really cared. They only wanted to make a fast paced Super Mario Movie with as many callbacks and in-house jokes as possible, and that is it. There is no deeper meaning, nothing new, no real character development, nothing worth noting. Also most of the fun stuff you already saw in the trailer, it is not much else. So lazily done.Sure you might have fun watching this, because it is not a bad movie, but will you remember this a few weeks from now? Will this be a classic? Do you want to see more? The answers to those questions is a big ""No"".In the end I give this a 5/10. If you have kids you think you might like this or you are high and want to get away from reality for a while, perhaps go see this. For the rest of you this will be a Meh at best.","

","First of all: This is A MOVIE FOR KIDS, it's not for grown ups, don't be a 30-something or 40-something years old and expect to see the best movie of your lifetime. It's not gonna happen, it's a kids movie.When I was a kid I saw the old Hopkins-Leguizamo movie... OMG, it was horrible. I get it, we didn't have CGI back then, but an animated movie like this one would have been amazing. Waaaay better than that... garbage of a film.This new one explores all the common elements of the franchise, beautifully crafted world with attention to details. My 7 year old girl LOVED IT. I was kinda bored, but she loved it, this rating is for her, that's what's important, it's a movie for kids, they should rate it.There are a lot of man-childs on the internet criticizing it. Don't listen to them. If you have a kid who loves Mario just take them, no doubt about it. If you're a nostalgic grown up, you're not going to have a bad time, but it's not what you expect, there are like 1 or 2 ""grown up jokes"", that's it, it's not like those disney movies that have a lot of hints for grown ups, this one doesn't, it's a KIDS MOVIE as it should be.I get that grown ups need to be entertained, but it shouldn't be the rule, the most important thing is that kids love it.","

","There are some very minor spoilers ahead, i just want to say that this movie exceeded my expectations! The Critic score should not be taken seriously it's nowhere near a bad nor average movie. There are some things that i didn't like about it but overall i left the theaters with a smile.The Visuals are probably the best Illumination Studios has ever done, very smooth and gorgeous to look at. The human characters like Mario, Luigi and Peach's faces look different from their videogame counterparts and kind of weird at first but you will get used to them and at least their clothing match but on the other hand the animals and creatures from the Mushroom Kingdom like the Koopas, Donkey Kong and Bowser all look very accurate and detailed.The Voice Acting, Sorry but Mario does NOT sound like Mario, at all in this movie! I'm not a fan of Chriss Pratt's acting as Mario. Luigi sounds better but not accurate either, Peach is good i guess and Donkey Kong sounds like Seth Rogen...Yay... Bowser however, gets a straight 10/10 Jack Black actually tried to sound like Bowser and he should be cast again as Bowser in future movies. Long time Mario fans will be surprised to know that Charles Martinet is also in the movie, but not as Mario... The character he got to act for is such a waste and not even worth mentioning to be honest.The Story is not your typical Mario videogame story, it's actually baffling at first how literal they took the Mario ""origin"" story of him being a New York plumber. The movie starts going in the wrong direction but as the movie goes on it becomes better and better and ultimately it worked in the end. The pacing is very fast there is no real character development except for Luigi and maybe Mario but there's just too many relevant characters and not enough time to flesh them out. At least they all have defined personalities.Overall, it's not an Amazing movie but definitely a fun and good first outing by Nintendo and Illumination, it's full of Mario references and just good fan service like a Mario movie should be. Here's hoping future Mario movies!!And 8 but giving it a 10 to even out the hater trolls.","

337,337,/tt6718170,TheMustardNerd,7 May 2023," Let's a go fast
","This is gonna be one of my shorter reviews, since the movie isn't bad, neither great.The voice acting was surprinsingly good. Keegan-Michael Key, Charlie Day, and Anna Taylor-Joy were my favourites. Chris Pratt as Mario worked pretty well, since this is a new take on the plumber.The visuals were good: colorful enviorements, beautiful effects and entertaining action.T
But the main problem with the movie is it's lenght. In 80 minutes, you don't get that much out of it. It feels like they had a script for a 2 hour movie , but it was shortened to not bore the kids in the audience and to save some cash.The movie features a lot of locations, but it's pretty lackluster in it's world building since we barely spend any time in those. The dialogue is extremely limited and the scenes go by so fast, that many times, they become somewhat irrelevant to the plot. Since the characters got out of a sticky situation with so much ease, it fails to make you care about anything. How am I supposed to care for Mario since he defeats his enemies with so much ease. Same with Peach: she just gets into sticky situations, but a few seconds later she just gets out of it with the help of some deus ex machina crap.There's no set up, no polished character arcs, there's no pay-off, no forshadowing, almost anything.The characters are flat, boring, and lacking in personality. Their relationships don't feel authentic, cause they barely spend any time together. The movie is so short that they spend like 30 minutes togehter (in the best case scenario, sometimes it can be less than 10 minutes) and at the end you're expected to feel like they formed some great friendship, to feel that they have chemistry and things in common beyond: their humans, they want to defeat the same villain.Also it has a lot of Mario Stuff I guess....The reception for this movie was kinda pathetic. It was either pretentious critics, acting like this movie killed cinema or some trash, or a bunch of manchildren who need everyone to agree with them ""What did you expect from a Mario Movie?"". From the Mario Movie. You would expect... a movie: a story with conflicts that pay off. Likeable characters and immersive world-building. It's a movie; of course I expect to me more complex than the Mario Games.I honestly didn't k=connect with the movie. I was just waiting for it to end. I didn't even intend to watch it until the internet decided that this is some ground breaking divisive movie. It's not. Maybe it's gonna leave a big impact on the industry, since in made over a billion dollars, but I highly doubt I'm gonna remember this movie once The Flash or the FNAF movie will come out, and people will move on to the next big shiny thing.With both terrible and good stuff, the movie is OK: a low-key waste of time, with mildly entertaining scenes and bright colors. I don't see anyone outside of Mario Fans and Families getting that out of this.","
